Based upon Machiavelli's first-hand experience as an emissary of the Florentine Republic to the courts of Europe, <em>The Prince</em> analyses the usually violent means by which men seize, retain, and lose political power. Machiavelli added a dimension of incisive realism to one of the major philosophical and political issues of his time, especially the relationship between public deeds and private morality. His book provides a remarkably uncompromising picture of the true nature of power, no matter in what era or by whom it is exercised.<br><br> This fluent new translation is accompanied by an introduction that considers the true purpose of <em>The Prince</em> and dispels some of the myths associated with it. It has the most comprehensive explanatory and critical notes found in any currently available English translation and the most comprehensive bibliography in any edition of the work. It also contains a helpful Glossary of Proper Names, an Index and a map.</p><p><br><strong>Peter Bondanella</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Comparative Literature and Italian at Indiana University. <strong>Maurizio Viroli</strong> is Professor of Politics at Princeton University.<br>Literary scholar Peter Bondanella rightly seeks the cold elegance and readability of the original. Serious English readers will want both translations.

The abridged classic makes the work more accessible while holding true to the intent and tradition of the classic.</p><p>Born in London in 1931, Kincaid studied illustration and design at Gravesend School of Art, where Peter Blake was a contemporary and Quentin Crisp one of the life models. In 1971, he was offered the chance to fulfill his true ambition, to illustrate childCharles Lutwidge Dodgson (1832&#x2013;1898), known by his pen name, Lewis Carroll, was an English mathematician, photographer, and prolific writer, especially known for his beloved books Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking-Glass. Preferring the company of children to adults, his Alice books were inspired by his friendship with the young Alice Liddell, the daughter of the Dean of Christ Church, where Carroll was a mathematics instructor.</p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Sartre (Cambridge Companions to Philosophy)</h2><p>This is one of the most comprehensive and up-to-date surveys of the philosophy of Sartre, by some of the foremost interpreters in the United States and Europe. The essays are both expository and original, and cover Sartre&#39;s writings on ontology, phenomenology, psychology, ethics, and aesthetics, as well as his work on history, commitment, and progress; a final section considers Sartre&#39;s relationship to structuralism and deconstruction. Providing a balanced view of Sartre&#39;s philosophy and situating it in relation to contemporary trends in Continental philosophy, the volume shows that many of the topics associated with Lacan, Foucault, L�vi-Strauss, and Derrida are to be found in the work of Sartre, in some cases as early as 1936. A special feature of the volume is the treatment of the recently published and hitherto little studied posthumous works. Thus new readers and nonspecialists will find this the most convenient, accessible guide to Sartre currently available. Advanced students and specialists will find a conspectus of recent developments in the interpretation of Sartre.</p><p>Providing a balanced view of Sartre&#39;s philosophy in relation to contemporary trends in Continental philosophy, this volume shows that many of the topics associated with Lacan, Foucault, Levi-Strauss, and Derrida are to be found in the work of Sartre, in some cases as early as 1936.This is a further volume in a series of companions to major philosophers.

He wrote six of the eight volumes of the landmark biographical series and also compiled ten volumes of Churchill documents. In addition, he is the author of a definitive history of the Holocaust, a series of twelve historical atlases, and comprehensive studies of both World War I and World War II. He is married with three children and lives in London. Since 1962, he has been a Fellow of Merton College, Oxford (an Honorary Fellow since 1994). He was knighted in 1995.</p><p>Preface</p><p>This atlas traces the world-wide Jewish migrations from ancient Mesopotamia to modern Israel. It seeks to follow the diverse-and sometimes obscure-path of a far-ranging people, and to map their strange experiences in good times and bad.</p><p>My original concern was to avoid undue emphasis upon the many horrific aspects of Jewish history. 1 wished to portray with equal force the construction, achievements and normalities of Jewish life through almost four thousand years. In part 1 believe that I have succeeded; for there are many maps of traders, philosophers, financiers, settlers and sages. But as my research into Jewish history progressed, I was surprised, depressed, and to some extent overwhelmed by the perpetual and irrational violence which pursued the Jews in every century and to almost every corner of the globe. If, therefore, persecution, expulsion, torture, humiliation, and mass murder haunt these pages, it is because they also haunt the Jewish story.</p><p>But not all terrors are unmitigated; and I have felt a great relief in being able also to map the other side of the coin-the Jewish revolts against Roman, Chinese and Persian oppression-the often repeated pattern of mutual self-help and communal charity, the self-defence leagues organized against the Russian and Ukrainian pogroms, the brave if hopeless risings in ghetto and concentration camp during the Nazi era, and the stubborn resistance to Arab pressures by modern Israel.</p><p>If this Atlas can help to answer even a small portion of the questions which Jews so often ask about themselves, or can tell Christians something more about the varied experiences of their neighbours, it will have served a purpose. In particular, 1 hope that the maps succeed in portraying the complex comings and goings of many different sorts of Jews, and the extraordinary diversity of the Jewish saga.</p><p>In this Atlas I have tried to look at the role of the Jews in their different national settings, and show their reaction to persecution, whether by dispersal, acceptance or defence. Both in resisting the continual pressure of hostile societies and in braving the dangers of flight and exile, the Jewish people have shown high courage and a keen capacity to rise again; "trampled into the dust" as Cardinal Manning described it, "and yet never combining with the dust into which it is trampled."</p><p>For those who wish to follow up some of the themes covered by the maps, I have provided a short bibliography. In it 1 have included a few general books, together with a number of specialist works in which I found information for remote or neglected topics.</p><p>Many of my maps are intended to make certain obscure episodes in Jewish history better known, if only in outline. There are many equally fascinating problems on which no detailed research has yet been done; and the history of the Jews which most people know is primarily the history of those episodes on which books or monographs have been written. There are still many areas of darkness. But as I hope this Atlas shows, those aspects of Jewish history which can be mapped are full of unusual details and dramatic moments, ranging over every continent and every civilization, and adding a unique dimension to the story of mankind.</p><p><br><br></p><p>Twenty-two years have now passed since the first edition of this atlas. The final maps of this fourth edition show the main developments in Jewish history since then. These include the emigration of more than half a million Jews from the Soviet Union to Israel between 1970 and 1990 (map 122). This map also shows Operation Solomon, which, with Operation Moses (map 119), brought more than 25,000 Ethiopian Jews to Israel.</p><p>I have brought up to date the map showing the number of non-Jews who were honoured for saving Jewish lives in the Second World War (map 104), and the map showing the number of Jews worldwide: this shows the Jewish population of Israel reaching four million in 1991 (map 123).</p><p>Several of the earlier maps have been redrawn with extra material, including a map showing Blood Libel accusations in the Middle Ages and beyond, and two maps showing the scale of Jewish resistance during the Holocaust.</p><p>I am grateful in this new edition to the cartographic skills of Tim Aspden, and I should once more welcome any notice of errors, as well as suggestionsfor further maps.<br><br></p><p>MARTIN GILBERT<br>25 October 1991<i>Merton College, Oxford</i></p></p><h2>Carson Dellosa | Common Core Math 4 Today Workbook | 5th Grade, 96pgs (Common Core 4 Today)</h2><p>Build a foundation and focus on what matters most for math readiness with Common Core Math 4 Today: Daily Skill Practice for fifth grade.

Where she came from, who her parents were, and who really stole the gold are the secrets that permeate this moving tale of guilt and innocence. A moral allegory of the redemptive power of love, it is also a finely drawn picture of early nineteenth-century England in the days when spinning wheels hummed busily in the farmhouses, and of a simple way of life that was soon to disappear.<p></p><p>"I think <i>Silas Marner</i> holds a higher place than any of the author's works.

These were the manuscripts read by the earliest Christians, which comprised their "New Testament." In his volumes, Philip Wesley Comfort bridges the gap between these extant copies and today's critical text by providing accurate transcriptions of the earliest New Testament manuscripts, with photographs on the facing pages so readers can see the works for themselves. Comfort also provides an introduction to each manuscript that summarizes the content, date, current location, provenance, and other essential information, including the latest findings. This allows students and scholars to make well-informed decisions about the translation and interpretation of the New Testament.<br><br>Volume 1 includes manuscripts from Papyrus 1-72. Volume 2 includes manuscripts from Papyrus 75-139 as well as from the uncials. In addition, it features a special section on determining the date of a manuscript.

She wrote seven popular, critically acclaimed books about her journeys to remote Native communities and about her life as an artist as well as her life as a small child in Victoria at the turn of the last century.<br><br>The Book of Small is a collection of 36 short stories about a childhood in a town that still had vestiges of its pioneer past. With an uncanny skill at bringing people to life, Emily Carr tells stories about her family, neighbours, friends and strangers who run the gamut from genteel people in high society to disreputable frequenters of saloons as well as an array of beloved pets. All are observed through the sharp eyes and ears of a young, ever-curious and irrepressible girl, and Carr&#x2019;s writing is a disarming combination of charm and devastating frankness.<br><br>Carr&#x2019;s writing is vital and direct, aware and poignant, and as well regarded today as when she was first published to both critical and popular acclaim. The Book of Small has been in print ever since its publication in 1942, and, like Klee Wyck, has been read and loved by a couple of generations.<br></p><p>Emily Carr was born in Victoria, British Columbia, in 1871, and died there in 1945. She studied art in San Francisco, London and Paris. Except for a period of fifteen years when she was discouraged by the reception to her work, she was a commited painter. After 1927, when she was encouraged by the praise of the Group of Seven, interest in her paintings grew and she gained recognition as one of Canada&#x2019;s most gifted artists. Now, nearly sixty years after her death, her reputation continues to grow.<br><br>There is an excellent website devoted to Emily Carr, her lift, her art and her writing, at http://www.tbc.gov.bc.ca/culture/schoolnet/carr/<br><br>Sarah Ellis is an award-winning writer and children's librarian, as well as being a sought-after speaker at conferences and workshops throughout North America and Europe.

Sufficiently varied to reflect the wealth of available material, they include highlights from Aristotle's <i>Politics </i>and<i> Nicomachean Ethics,</i> St. Thomas Aquinas's <i>Summa Theologica,</i> Thomas Mun's <i>England's Treasure by Forraign Trade,</i> and David Hume's <i>Political Discourses.</i> Helpful biographical notes appear at the start of each author's work.</p><p></p><h2>Opium: A History</h2><p>Eight pages of photographs accompany this striking text, which delves deeply into the history and often unexplored cultural impact of a narcotic whose use has spanned centuries and forms, from smoking dens in the 1800s to the heroin of today. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>With personages from Khun Sa to Coleridge to Kurt Cobain populating its far-ranging pages, <i>Opium: A History</i> provides a comprehensive look at the drug as it's been used, abused, fought over, and profited from throughout the millennia. In all likelihood, one of the first medicinal drugs known to mankind, opium and its derivatives have eased and caused suffering in almost equal measure, a fact that the evenhanded Booth takes pains to point out. In fact, he quotes rock musician Frank Zappa with approbation: "A drug is neither moral nor immoral--it's a chemical compound. The compound itself is not a menace to society until a human being treats it as if consumption bestowed a temporary license to act like an asshole." Booth's book traces opium's history from the first evidence of poppy cultivation (possibly as early as 4,000 B.C.) to the drug wars of today, exploring its uses in different cultures, its roles in British and Chinese political affairs, its use by artists and musicians, and its horrifying ramifications for addicts. <p> Booth writes with admirable attention to detail, if very little �lan. Plowing through some of his sentences is a little like chewing on a mouthful of sawdust: "There are several reasons suggested for the popularity of the hypodermic but the primary one is the lowering standard of heroin purity caused by the success of legislation on production and by the selling methods employed by Italians who took over distribution from Jewish gangs, leading to an increase in price and higher levels of adulteration." It's enough to drive a reader to drugs. Nonetheless, the power of his narrative can't be entirely erased by the unwieldiness of his prose. The book is filled with striking images and surprising facts--for instance, opium-addicted Victorian children, fed "soothing syrups" by minders to keep them quiet. Undernourished, yellow-skinned, in the words of one contemporary observer, they "shrank up into little old men or wizened like a little monkey." In the end, Booth finds few answers to the problems posed by the opium trade--a scourge he says has "destroyed millions of lives, enslaved whole cultures and invidiously corrupted human society to its very core." In writing this exhaustively researched history, however, Booth brings us that much closer to understanding--and thereby conquering--the most tenacious of human addictions. <i>--Mary Park</i></p>"A great sprawling catalogue of sheer information about opium and its effects over the last 4,000 years, during which it has always been both a blessing and a curse." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> "The book's wealth of detail is remarkable." --<i>The Economist</i></p><p> "<i>Opium</i> is of great value for its thoroughness, and it is briskly written....Each chapter [is] a ball of opium with an explosive charge." --<i>The Boston Globe</i></p><p> "Booth takes us from <i>P. somniferum</i> to 'black gold,' compellingly documenting the influential role of the opiate trade throughout history." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p><p> "From the subtleties of Chinese history to the complexities of Golden Triangle narco-nationalism...Booth shows us a sure grasp of his material and manages to pull the innumerable and far-flung threads...neatly together." --<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>Plato: The Great Philosophers (The Great Philosophers Series)</h2><p>Philosophy is one of the most intimidating and difficult of disciplines, as any of its students can attest. This book is an important entry in a distinctive new series from Routledge: The Great Philosophers. Breaking down obstacles to understanding the ideas of history&#39;s greatest thinkers, these brief, accessible, and affordable volumes offer essential introductions to the great philosophers of the Western tradition from Plato to Wittgenstein. In just 64 pages, each author, a specialist on his subject, places the philosopher and his ideas into historical perspective. Each volume explains, in simple terms, the basic concepts, enriching the narrative through the effective use of biographical detail. And instead of attempting to explain the philosopher&#39;s entire intellectual history, which can be daunting, this series takes one central theme in each philosopher&#39;s work, using it to unfold the philosopher&#39;s thoughts.</p><p>Once in a while, a publication comes along that on first sight seems oddly out of place but on second viewing is admirably suited to its purpose. This little series of biographical summaries of the thoughts of 24 Western philosophers from Democritus to Derrida is admirable not only for its reasonable price but even more for the intelligence and clarity of the writing. Each volume has been prepared by an expert in the subject, and the result is a series of well-drawn and exceptionally useful pocket-size (4.5 x 7 inches) sketches of major figures in the history of Western thought. The level is such that no special background in philosophy is required to understand the concepts discussed. Each volume also contains a short bibliography, some of which refer to electronic journals or web sites. Most of the individuals chosen for the series come as no surprise, e.g., Descartes, Hegel, Kant, Nietzsche, Locke, Hume, Plato, and Socrates. But there are a few unexpected choices, like Alan Turing and Karl PopperAalthough on further consideration, they make more sense. Turing's influence on mathematics and on the development of computers has long been recognized, but his 1936 paper "On Compatible Numbers," which appeared in the Proceedings of the London Mathematical Society in 1936-37, influenced studies in the philosophy of mind. Popper's development of the concept of "historicism" in such works as The Open Society and Its Enemies and The Poverty of Historicism significantly influenced 20th-century political thought. Ultimately, this set should be in every academic and public library as well as many school libraries.ATerry C. Skeats, Bishop's Univ.

Were the railways vital to Prussia&#39;s victory over France in 1870? Was the famous Schlieffen Plan militarily sound? Could the European half of World War II have been ended in 1944? These are only a few of the questions that form the subject-matter of this meticulously researched, lively book. Drawing on a very wide range of unpublished and previously unexploited sources, Martin van Creveld examines the &#39;nuts and bolts&#39; of war: namely, those formidable problems of movement and supply, transportation and administration, so often mentioned - but rarely explored - by the vast majority of books on military history. In doing so he casts his net far and wide, from Gustavus Adolphus to Rommel, from Marlborough to Patton, subjecting the operations of each to a thorough analysis from a fresh and unusual point of view. The result is a fascinating book that has something new to say about virtually every one of the most important campaigns waged in Europe during the last two centuries.</p><p>Drawing on a very wide rang of unpublished and previously unexploited sources, Martin van Creveld examines the &#39;nuts and bolts&#39; of war: namely, those formidable problems of movement and supply, transportation and administration, so often mentioned--but rarely explored--by the vast majority of books on military history.

When God came to earth in human flesh as the New Covenant, these believers discovered the freedom they could have in Jesus and the relationship they could enjoy with Him. Yet in the midst of persecution and rejection, they were often tempted to hold on to the former symbols, rituals, and traditions grounded in the requirements of the Old Covenant.</p><p>The unknown author of Hebrews sought to address this problem by contrasting the Old and New Covenants, brilliantly showing that Christ is higher than any Old Testament character, priest, ritual, or sacrifice.

Reminiscent of classics like Hemingway's <i>A Farewell to Arms</i> and Remarque's <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>, <i>Under Fire</i> (originally published in French as <i>La Feu</i>) vividly evokes life in the trenches: the mud, stench, and monotony of waiting while constantly fearing for one's life in an infernal and seemingly eternal battlefield.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines.

(<i>History Today</i>)</p><h2>The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn</h2><p>Before Anton Chekhov and Mark Twain can be used in school readers and exams, they must be vetted by a bias and sensitivity committee. An anthology used in Tennessee schools changed &#x201c;By God!&#x201d; to &#x201c;By gum!&#x201d; and &#x201c;My God!&#x201d; to &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t mean it.&#x201d; The New York State Education Department omitted mentioning Jews in an Isaac Bashevis Singer story about prewar Poland, or blacks in Annie Dillard&#x2019;s memoir of growing up in a racially mixed town. California rejected a reading book because The Little Engine That Could was male. <br><br>Diane Ravitch maintains that America&#x2019;s students are compelled to read insipid texts that have been censored and bowdlerized, issued by publishers who willingly cut controversial material from their books&#x2014;a case of the bland leading the bland. <br><br><b>The Language Police </b>is the first full-scale expos� of this cultural and educational scandal, written by a leading historian. It documents the existence of an elaborate and well-established protocol of beneficent censorship, quietly endorsed and implemented by test makers and textbook publishers, states, and the federal government. School boards and bias and sensitivity committees review, abridge, and modify texts to delete potentially offensive words, topics, and imagery. Publishers practice self-censorship to sell books in big states. <br><br>To what exactly do the censors object? A typical publisher&#x2019;s guideline advises that <br><br>� Women cannot be depicted as caregivers or doing<br>household chores.<br>� Men cannot be lawyers or doctors or plumbers.<br> They must be nurturing helpmates.<br>� Old people cannot be feeble or dependent; they<br> must jog or repair the roof.<br>� A story that is set in the mountains discriminates<br> against students from flatlands.<br>� Children cannot be shown as disobedient or in<br> conflict with adults.<br>� Cake cannot appear in a story because it is not<br> nutritious. <br><br>The result of these revisions are&#x2014;no surprise!&#x2014;boring, inane texts about a cotton-candy world bearing no resemblance to what children can access with the click of a remote control or a computer mouse. Sadly, data show that these efforts to sanitize language do not advance learning or bolster test scores, the very <br>reason given for banning allegedly insensitive words and topics. <br><br>Ravitch offers a powerful political and economic analysis of the causes of censorship. She has practical and sensible solutions for ending it, which will improve the quality of books for students as well as liberating publishers, state boards of education, and schools from the grip of pressure groups. <br><br>Passionate and polemical,<b> The Language Police</b> is a book for every educator, concerned parent, and engaged citizen.</p><p>The impulse in the 1960s and &#x2018;70s to achieve fairness and a balanced perspective in our nation&#x2019;s textbooks and standardized exams was undeniably necessary and commendable. Then how could it have gone so terribly wrong? Acclaimed education historian Diane Ravitch answers this question in her informative and alarming book, <i>The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn</i>. Author of 7 books, Ravitch served as the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Education from 1991 to 1993. Her expertise and her 30-year commitment to education lend authority and urgency to this important book, which describes in copious detail how pressure groups from the political right and left have wrested control of the language and content of textbooks and standardized exams, often at the expense of the truth (in the case of history), of literary quality (in the case of literature), and of education in general. Like most people involved in education, Ravitch did not realize "that educational materials are now governed by an intricate set of rules to screen out language and topics that might be considered controversial or offensive." In this clear-eyed critique, she is an unapologetic challenger of the ridiculous and damaging extremes to which bias guidelines and sensitivity training have been taken by the federal government, the states, and textbook publishers. <p></p> In a multi-page sampling of rejected test passages, we discover that "in the new meaning of bias, it its considered biased to acknowledge that lack of sight is a disability," that children who live in urban areas cannot understand passages about the country, that the Aesop fable about a vain (female) fox and a flattering (male) crow promotes gender bias. As outrageous as many of the examples are, they do not appear particularly dangerous. However, as the illustrations of abridgment, expurgation, and bowdlerization mount, the reader begins to understand that our educational system is indeed facing a monumental crisis of distortion and censorship. Ravitich ends her book with three suggestions of how to counter this disturbing tendency. Sadly, however, in the face of the overwhelming tide of misinformation that has already been entrenched in the system, her suggestions provide cold comfort. <i>--Silvana Tropea</i>&#x201c;Lucid, forceful, written with insight, passion, compassion and conviction, <b><i>The Language Police</i></b> is not only hair-raisingly readable but deeply reasonable. It should be required reading not only for parents, teachers and educators, but for everyone who cares about history, literature, science, culture and indeed the civilization in which we live.&#x201d; --Merle Rubin, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>&#x201c;Revealing and important... Ravitch richly illustrates her case... her compilation of evidence and argument is overwhelming.&#x201d; --Daniel Kevles, <i>New York Times Book Review<br><br></i>&#x201c;Fiercely argued... Ms. Ravitch ... writes with enormous authority and common sense. She shows how priggish, censorious and downright absurd ''the language police'' can be, and she does so with furious logic. Every bit as alarming as it is illuminating.&#x201d;--Michiko Kakutani, <i>New York Times<br><br></i>&#x201c;Ravitch (is) ... whistle-blower extraordinaire.&#x201d;--Gary Rosen, <i>Wall Street Journal</i><br><br>&#x201c;It should make you scream.&#x201d; -- Jane Eisner, <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i><br><br>&#x201c;A stunning piece of research and exposition that uncovers the hidden censorship currently practiced in the public schools through all reading matter. The prohibition of a great many words and subjects and the substitution for some of clumsy phrases shows up the censors as both self-righteous and of feeble mind. They are not warring against the improper or the sophisticated, but against fancied causes of bias or upset through the unfamiliar. The net effect is to render any piece of print so vapid as to neutralize its capacity to teach the child anything new and certain to bore him cruelly.&#x201d;&#x2013;Jacques Barzun</p><h2>WRITING COACH 2012 STUDENT EDITION GRADE 06</h2><p>WRITING COACH 2012 NATIONAL STUDENT EDITION GRADE 6 (NATL)</p><p></p><h2>Managing Your Documentation Projects</h2><p>Practical, authoritative, and the first comprehensive guide tomanaging every phase of your publication project.

Says Smedes: I want to see in a realistic way how the power of love can reshape our lives. I am not working out a &#x201c;love ethic&#x201d;; I do not lay down the duties of love. I assume that love is a power, and that it enables us before it obligates us. But ideal love does not work in an ideal world. It works within the limits of our ordinary lives....My object is to see how it works and what happens when it does.

Modern descendants can be found in the antics of a comic like Charles Chaplin. But as an institution it was unique &#x2014; a perfected theater of improvisation where gifted actors created some of the most memorable characters the theatre has ever seen. It was from this enchanting world that Harlequin and Punch, the Doctor and the Captain, Pantaloon and Brighella emerged to reign over Europe for three centuries. Writers, composers, and painters have drawn inspiration from the <i>commedia</i>; its influence is obvious in the work of Lope de Vega, the English Elizabethan dramatists, Moli�re, Callot, Watteau, C�zanne, and Picasso.<br>One of the most important books written on this aspect of theatrical history is this famous study. Tracing the beginnings, growth, and influence of the <i>commedia dell&#x2019;arte,</i> Duchartre describes the improvisations, staging, masks, scenarios, acting troupes, and characters that made up this special form of theater. Unfortunately, the English translation that appeared in 1929 has been out of print for decades, leaving scholars and theater lovers without a valuable source. This republication brings Duchartre&#x2019;s account back into print, illustrated with the more than 200 drawings and photographs it originally contained, plus a new pictorial supplement containing 35 plates from the <i>Recueil Fossard,</i> a rare collection of sixteenth-century engravings, and eight plates from <i>Compositions de rh�torique de M. don Arlequin,</i> which gives a view of Harlequin during the Renaissance.<br>Here are some of the reviews this book originally received: &#x201c;A scrupulously studious work, and a sympathetic one ... valuable sourcebook.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Bookmarks.</i> &#x201c;Exhaustive and scholarly but hilariously entertaining treatment.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Christian Century.</i> &#x201c;The author has gleaned from every source well-ordered information which makes this volume a complete seismographic record of one of the greatest eruptions of the comic spirit in all times.&#x201d; &#x2014; <i>Saturday Review of Literature.<br></i>This republication is sure to be no less well received. It has already merited an enthusiastic response from Eric Bentley: &#x201c;A very important standard work. Its unavailability of recent years &#x2014; of recent decades &#x2014; has been a calamity for all who work in the field. Its reappearance will make a big difference.

He led the U.S. intelligence community through a period that included the raid on Osama bin Laden, the Benghazi attack, the leaks of Edward Snowden, and Russia's influence operation during the 2016 U.S. election campaign. In <i>Facts and Fears</i>, Clapper traces his career through the growing threat of cyberattacks, his relationships with presidents and Congress, and the truth about Russia's role in the presidential election. He describes, in the wake of Snowden and WikiLeaks, his efforts to make intelligence more transparent and to push back against the suspicion that Americans' private lives are subject to surveillance. Finally, it was living through Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and seeing how the foundations of American democracy were--and continue to be--undermined by a foreign power that led him to break with his instincts honed through more than five decades in the intelligence profession to share his inside experience.<br><br>Clapper considers such controversial questions as, Is intelligence ethical? Is it moral to intercept communications or to photograph closed societies from orbit? What are the limits of what we should be allowed to do? What protections should we give to the private citizens of the world, not to mention our fellow Americans? Are there times when intelligence officers can lose credibility as unbiased reporters of hard truths by inserting themselves into policy decisions?<br><br><i>Facts and Fears</i> offers a privileged look inside the U.S. intelligence community and, with the frankness and professionalism for which James Clapper is known, addresses some of the most difficult challenges in our nation's history.</p><p><b>James Clapper</b> served as the fourth United States Director of National Intelligence--the United States' top intelligence officer and President Obama's senior intelligence advisor--from 2010 until 2017. Beginning his career as an enlisted Marine Corps reservist in 1961, Clapper eventually became a three-star Air Force lieutenant general and director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, retiring from uniformed service in 1995. In 2001 he returned to service, becoming the first civilian director of the National Imaging and Mapping Agency just three days after 9/11. In 2007 he was appointed the Pentagon's top intelligence official, serving as an appointee for both the Bush and Obama administrations before President Obama appointed him as DNI.<br><br><b>Trey Brown</b> is a 1997 graduate of the US Naval Academy who started his career as a helicopter pilot and was twice deployed to the Persian Gulf before returning to teach at his alma mater. After serving as a US Navy spokesman from the Pentagon, he joined the Office of the DNI, where he began writing speeches in 2011. He has written hundreds of speeches, eight which were published in the world's top speechwriting journal, <i>Vital Speeches of the Day</i>, and was James Clapper's speechwriter for his final three years as DNI. Clapper's speech to Morehouse College, "Why Black Lives Matter to US Intelligence" received the grand prize of the 2017 international Cicero speechwriting award.<p>Chapter One</p><p>Born into the Intelligence Business <br><br>When I accepted President Obama's offer to be the director of national intelligence, I was pushing seventy years old. Today, of course, I'm dragging it closer and closer to eighty. One reason that's significant is that both the earliest notions of a US Intelligence Community and the menace of the Soviet threat to the West were born about the same time as I was. My father was drafted into the Army in 1944, when I was three years old. As a signals intelligence officer during the war, he supported intercepting Japanese and German communications used to help the Allies win the war. He became deeply committed to the mission and respected the people he worked with, and before the ink was dry on the Japanese instrument of unconditional surrender, he'd decided to stay in the Army while most everyone else was demobilizing and shedding the uniform. Growing up and moving around from one signals intelligence site to another, I learned from a very early age to never&#x2014;<i>never</i>&#x2014;talk about what my dad did. I think my parents would be shocked, and my mother also mildly amused, that after retiring from the intelligence profession in 2017, I'd try to publicly explain what the Intelligence Community&#x2014;the "IC"&#x2014;is, what it does, and what it should stand for.<br><br></p><p>For me, this seven-decade-and-more journey started with a bang, and not a good one. My earliest vivid memory is of my mother and me entering the port of Leghorn (Livorno), Italy, in 1946, on our way to meet my dad in Eritrea, on the Horn of Africa. We were among the first US dependents to cross the Atlantic after the war, a trip my mother portrayed as a big adventure&#x2014;I'm sure to calm her own apprehensions as much as mine. US forces had liberated the city of Leghorn from the Germans in 1944 and still occupied it and controlled the harbor, but postwar Italy wasn't precisely safe for US dependents, or really for anyone. As our troopship, the USS <i>Fred T. Berry</i>, entered the harbor, I heard and felt an explosion, and the ship went dead in the water. Its alarm bells started ringing, three rings and a pause, and then repeated&#x2014;I can still hear the shrill sound&#x2014;and we rushed topside. Huddling on the deck, I felt my mother gripping the back of my far-too-big life preserver and watched as lifeboats were lowered over the side. She told me years later that the crew had barely kept the ship from sinking. As we were towed into port, the mast tops of sunken ships slowly passed to either side, looking every bit like crosses in a graveyard for vessels not as fortunate as ours.<br><br></p><p>We spent a couple of weeks in Leghorn while the rudder was repaired and then continued on our voyage to Africa. In Alexandria, my dad bribed the harbor pilot with a carton of cigarettes to take him out to meet us as our ship made its way into port. I don't recall arriving in Egypt, but my second vivid childhood memory is of leaving, my mother shaking me from sleep in a hotel in Cairo while my dad quickly packed our bags. She told me, calmly but urgently, that we had to go to Payne Field, Cairo's airport, and leave the country immediately. I was barely awake as we raced to board an airplane. The family legend is that King Farouk had met them that night in the hotel bar, which must have seemed like amazing luck, at least until the king made a pass at my mother, my dad tried to punch him, and we all had to depart in a hurry. It's not good to take a swing at the king.<br><br></p><p>It took eight weeks for my mother and me to travel from Fort Wayne, Indiana, to the primitive but very pretty city of Asmara, Eritrea, which sat atop a 7,500-foot-high plateau. Today Eritrea is a small, independent, and largely forgotten nation on the Red Sea, bordering the African powerhouses of Ethiopia and Sudan. Before the war, it had been in the Italian colony of Abyssinia, but when I arrived in 1946 it was part of Ethiopia, and the long war resulting in Eritrean independence was still a few years off. The locals viewed Americans with reverence; in their eyes we were rich and powerful, even though we lived in a converted barracks building on a former Italian Navy communications station. I made friends, both with the local kids and a few other Army brats, and learned Italian to fluency, but, of course, have forgotten it all since.<br><br></p><p>One day a friend and I were playing in the Army salvage dump, which was off-limits, but there was so much cool military equipment left over from the war, it was hard to stay away. I picked up a glass vial and dumped out what appeared to be rainwater but was in fact sulfuric acid, which ran down my left leg. I knew I was in trouble when part of my pants began to disappear and my leg started steaming. I ran home, scared to death. The Asmara doctor&#x2014;one of only seven officers on the post&#x2014;had just stopped by our quarters, and he and my mother dumped me in the bathtub, emptying a ten-pound bag of baking soda my mother had just bought at the commissary onto me, which was exactly the right emergency procedure. My recovery took months and involved a lot of painful skin grafts, and my dad never forgave himself, since he was the logistics officer responsible for the dump. My accident convinced them that remote stations might not have adequate medical care for small children prone to self-inflicted disasters, and so, in 1948, when I was seven and my parents learned my mother was pregnant, they decided it was time to return to the States.<br><br></p><p>Some forty-three years later, when I was director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, I visited Asmara and walked around the compound, which was by then an abandoned Eritrean Army post. I was amazed how dinky it seemed compared to the huge complex I remembered, but it was unmistakably the same place. I found the foundation footings of what had been our quarters, and the original Italian Navy communications towers were still there.<br><br></p><p>My memories of the trip back to the United States are as vivid as those of the trip to Eritrea. We flew out on Ethiopian Airlines, which consisted of a few olive drab B-17s with "EAL" printed on their tails. Our pilot, "Bail Out" Wicker, told us he got his name because he'd parachuted out of more than one B-17 during the war. That did not inspire confidence in seven-year-old Jimmy Clapper, but thankfully we encountered no emergencies on our flight. I will never forget sitting in the nose bubble, which still had its machine-gun mount, and flying into Payne Field, where planes abandoned after the war were parked in the desert as far as the eye could see: fighters, bombers, transport planes, all baking in the sun. From Cairo, we flew to Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and stayed five days, waiting for a plane to Germany. I remember standing outside our motel in short pants as the blowing sand stung my legs. We flew on a big, slow C-54 (a redesignated DC-4) from Dhahran to Frankfurt, which was still in rubble, with people everywhere begging for handouts. We stayed overnight in Bad Soden, outside the city, with no potable water, and I recall being very thirsty. From Frankfurt, we spent a day and a half on a train to Bremerhaven, single-tracking the whole way and passing mile after mile of abandoned or destroyed rolling stock: locomotives, tankers, passenger cars, and freight cars. In retrospect, Germany's recovery from the war is a remarkable achievement. Finally, we sailed back to the United States on another converted troopship.<br><br></p><p>My dad was assigned to Vint Hill Farms Station in Virginia, which was at the time an Army signals intelligence post outside Washington. I was a huge fan of Superman and Batman, and I had a large collection of their comics, which I kept in strict chronological order and took very good care of. They'd be worth a fortune today. But when we had to relocate again, there were strict weight limits for transporting household goods and my parents didn't want to use up their allowance with a lot of comic books. I was told we had to leave them behind, and so, with much regret, I handed over my entire pristine-condition collection to a bratty four-year-old girl named Sue. Seventeen years later, after many more moves for both of us, I married Sue, despite the fact that she no longer had my comics.<br><br></p><p>I wasn't aware of it, but that was a tough move for my parents, too, as we were forced to separate for a while. In 1950, after the North Koreans invaded South Korea, my dad was sent to Chitose, Japan, as the second-in-command of a small Army signals intelligence unit supporting the war effort. Chitose is on Hokkaido, the second largest, northernmost, and least populated of Japan's four main islands. It's just across the Sea of Japan and on about the same latitude as Vladivostok, Russia. Because we couldn't join him until suitable facilities for dependents were built, my mother, sister, and I returned to Fort Wayne, living with my grandparents on their 160 acres while I was in fourth grade and part of fifth, before we joined my dad near the end of 1951.<br><br></p><p>Regular Army soldiers viewed the signals intelligence guys in the Army Security Agency as having more brains than brawn and more of an affinity for electronics than shooting, fighting, and sleeping on the ground. But in Chitose, every now and then the commanding officer and my dad wanted to remind the troops that they were part of the Army, and so they'd take the signals intelligence unit to the field and practice putting up tents, operating a field mess, and doing weapons proficiency training. My dad took me along on one of these summer encampments, equipped with cut-down fatigues, a web belt, a canteen, the smallest helmet liner my dad could find, and even a small backpack. The first sergeant, the senior enlisted man in the unit, took a shine to me and let me carry his (unloaded) M1 rifle, or maybe he saw me as a convenient way to get out of having to carry it himself. Either way, it was a cool experience for an eleven-year-old, and undoubtedly something that can't be done in today's Army, even on Bring Your Child to Work Day.<br><br></p><p>I was enamored with the little I knew of my dad's work, and I was learning a lot about soldiering from watching him, but it was something my mother did in Chitose in 1952 that had a lifelong impact on how I viewed the world. This was before the Supreme Court's 1954 <i>Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka</i> ruling that desegregated schools in the States, but it was four years after President Truman signed Executive Order 9981, banning racial discrimination in the military. The executive order may have desegregated the armed forces institutionally, but not socially.<br><br></p><p>Much of the social life on military bases, particularly overseas, and certainly on the remote base in Chitose, was centered on the Officers' Club. On Sundays the club always served a fancy brunch, putting out its best linen and china and hiring a Japanese band to play and sing its amusing interpretations of popular American songs. The officers, including my dad, who was then a captain, wore dress uniforms, while their wives were in their Sunday best, complete with hats and white gloves. Even the kids dressed up, which for me was torture.<br><br></p><p>At my age, I didn't know and didn't care about who the senior officers in the club were; I didn't know the colonels and lieutenant colonels. But one Sunday, I recognized my dentist, who was a first lieutenant, a junior Army officer like my dad, and one of the very few black Army officers on the base. On that day my family had a prime table near the band, but when my dentist came in, he took a seat by himself on the perimeter of the room. I noticed him there but didn't think much of it. When the music stopped, my mother&#x2014;and I'm sure she picked this timing on purpose&#x2014;stood up and rather ostentatiously walked over to my dentist's table. Many of the officers and their wives in the room noticed and pointedly watched her. She talked with him for a minute or two, invited him to sit with us, took him by the hand, and led him through the center of the room to our table. As she did, all the senior officers began staring at my dad, their faces projecting their unspoken questions&#x2014;<i>What is your wife doing? Can't you get her under control?</i> I'll never forget my dad's expression&#x2014;a mixture of amusement, admiration, and fear. But to his great credit, he made my sister and me shift our chairs to make room at the table for our guest.<br><br></p><p>There may have been consequences for my parents, although if there were, they never mentioned them. In fact, my mother never said a word about what she'd done, even though she spoke to me about a lot of other things, sometimes incessantly. That may be why I remember that Sunday brunch so vividly, even though it was more than sixty-five years ago. When I was at a very impressionable age, my mother showed me that the color of someone's skin doesn't determine the human dignity they deserve. That lesson stayed with me and influenced decisions I've made in both my personal and professional lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When my family left Japan in 1953, en route to Littleton, Massachusetts, my sister and I were parked with my mother's parents in Philadelphia. This was a good deal for me, because my grandparents let me stay up as late as I wanted to watch TV. Television was a great novelty, since we didn't have one in Japan. On Friday nights, the old movies would end about 12:30, and one night I did the 1950s equivalent of channel surfing, which required actually walking up to the set and manually turning the selector dial. There were only four channels, and one night I stopped between channels four and five&#x2014;I'll never forget this&#x2014;because I heard voices speaking in a clipped cadence. There was no picture, just voices. I listened for maybe fifteen minutes as they batted words and numbers back and forth in speech patterns bordering on the nonsensical. Finally I figured out that I'd stumbled onto the broadcast frequency of the Philadelphia Police Department dispatcher. I wanted to hear more, but my arm was getting tired, so I went to the kitchen, found some toothpicks, and stuck them in the dial to secure it. That's right, I "hacked" the Philadelphia Police Department, using my grandparents' black-and-white TV set and some toothpicks.<br><br>The next night I was prepared with a map of the city of Philadelphia and began plotting the addresses where the police cruisers were dispatched. After a few nighttime surveillance sessions, I figured out where the police district boundaries were, based on which cruisers responded&nbsp;to specific locations. I wrote down anything they said that I didn&#x2019;t understand,and kept listening until I had figured out what all the &#x201c;10&#x201d; codes (10-4, 10-5, etc.) were, the system for call signs, and the personal identifiers for lieutenants and above. I got a pack of index cards to keep track of all the facts I was collecting. Soon I was staying up every night to build my &#x201c;database.&#x201d; About a month later, when my parents came to Philadelphia to retrieve my sister and me, my dad asked, &#x201c;So what&#x2019;ve you been up to this summer?&#x201d; I showed him my map and my card files, and I gave him a thorough briefing on how police operations worked in the city. I&#x2019;ll never forget the expression on his face as he exclaimed, &#x201c;My God, I&#x2019;ve raised my own replacement!&#x201d;</p></p><h2>America in the 1960s (Decades of American History)</h2><p>Designed to be accessible to young readers, these volumes offer a way of learning about the history of America.

Wild Heron, located just south of Savannah on the Little Ogeechee River, is the oldest plantation house still standing in Georgia. A one-and-a-half story farmhouse built in the style of a West India cottage, it is being restored to reflect the period of the early 1800s.Farther to the interior, in the area around Augusta, are such homes as Fruitlands, now the clubhouse of the Augusta national Golf Club; Meadow Garden; Ware's Folly; and Montrose, built in 1849 and one of the Loveliest Greek Revival houses in the area. Houses photographed along the Plantation Trail, from Athens to Macon, include the white-columned President's House, home since 1949 to the presidents of the University of Georgia; the Howell Cobb House, in Athens; Whitehall, in Covington; Glan Mary, in Sparta; and the Woodruff House, in Macon.Gleason devotes considerable attention to the homes of the western side of the state, from Chickamauga to Thomasville. The Gordon-Lee House, constructed in 1847, was headquarters fro the Union army during the battle of chickamauga. Other houses in this part of Georgia are valley View, which overlooks the Etowah River, west of Cartersville; the Archibald Howell House, near downtown Marietta; Lovejoy, in Clayton Country; The oaks, in the vicinity of LaGrange; and Greenwood and Pebble Hill, near Thomasville.In all, Gleason captures more than one hundred of Georgia's most beautiful antebellum homes, including many lesser-known houses. In addition to exterior photographs, Antebellum Homes of Georgia contains a number of interior views as well as aerial photographs that show the relationship between the houses and their environs: outbuildings, formal gardens, and recd clay fields that were once white with cotton. Captions provide brief histories of the houses and their owners as weel as notes on construction and outstanding architectural details.</p></p><p>From the stately Gothic Revival and Regency-style houses of Savannah to the majestic, multicolored plantation homes that punctuate rolling farmlands throughout the state, David King Gleason presents a splendid pictorial record of Georgia&#39;s finest pre-Civil War residences.<p>David King Gleason was a photographer who lived and worked in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

It draws not only on the extremely rich pictorial record, but also on evidence from textual references, mummified animals, food offerings placed in burials and bone remains recovered from settlement sites.</p><p></p><h2>Mechanical Drawing Board &amp; CAD Techniques, Student Edition (FRENCH: MECHANICAL DRAWING)</h2><p>Project-based learning prepares students for professional certification!</p><p>McGraw-Hill authors represent the leading experts in their fields and are dedicated to improving the lives, careers, and interests of readers worldwide</p><h2>The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County, and Other Sketches (1867) (The Oxford Mark Twain)</h2><p>Featuring 27 sketches the author wrote while living in California and Nevada, Mark Twain's first book, <em>The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County</em>, was published in May 1867, and has been out of print for well over a century. As Roy Blount Jr. observes in his introduction, "<em>Jumping Frog</em> is not just the seed from which the Mark Twain empire sprang, it is his most devilish and quicksilver book, the one that made the fewest concessions to the book-buying market of the day--the work of a man who had profited, artistically, from the company of roughnecks." In his Afterword, Richard Bucci notes that "Mark Twain rebelled against everything that was obscure in art, and everywhere sought to deepen and broaden his audience. His cause was not merely to deflate and criticize, but to create, in a new and democratic artistic language. The <em>Jumping Frog</em> book is only a small moment on his path to remaking American fiction, but it is the beginning moment--reason enough to justify the book's reappearance now, after one hundred twenty five years. Grand historical significance aside, however, not a few of the sketches in this book still sparkle with their original humor and insight into the human condition."</p><p>Shelley Fisher Fishkin, Professor of American Studies, University of Texas, Austin.</p><h2>Lippincott Textbook for Nursing Assistants</h2><p>The workbook to accompany Lippincott Textbook for Nursing Assistants, 4e provides students with a fun and engaging way of reviewing important concepts and vocabulary.

Tour.</p><p>DAN SIMMONS is a recipient of numerous major international awards, including the Hugo Award, World Fantasy Award, Bram Stoker Award, and the Shirley Jackson Award. He is widely considered to be one of the premier multiple-genre fiction writers in the world. His most recent novels include the New York Times bestsellers The Terror and Drood, as well as Black Hills. He lives along the Front Range in Colorado and has never grown tired of the views.In previous novels, Simmons has cast John Keats as an intergalactic emissary (Hyperion) and Mark Twain as an occult adventurer (Fires in Eden). His new excursion in fictional literary biography?and first nonfantasy since Phases of Gravity (1989)?is a gutsy speculation on Ernest Hemingway's exploits in wartime espionage, much of it apparently based on fact. In 1942, Hemingway petitioned the American embassy for help in establishing a counterintelligence outfit he called "The Crook Factory," designed to investigate Nazi activity in his adopted home of Cuba. Joe Lucas, a dedicated if unimaginative young FBI agent, thinks he has been assigned to humor the well-connected writer but soon discovers that Hemingway and his crew of colorful sycophants have stumbled on a Nazi spy nest abuzz with activity. Someone is channeling information through the island's intelligence underground, all of it implicating a host of historical celebrities. The more deeply Hemingway's team probes, the more Lucas is persuaded that the Crook Factory has been deliberately set up as an expendable military subterfuge. As vividly depicted by Simmons, pre-Communist Cuba is an exotic locale whose volatile wartime intrigues are comparable to those of the cinematic Casablanca. It's the perfect milieu for Hemingway, whose larger-than-life evocation must be accounted one of Simmons's sterling literary achievements. The macho figure he cuts here is the stuff of countless Life magazine photos, and his development as Joe's friend and mentor is handled with intelligence and dignity. No one will mistake the novel's immersions in the numbing, repetitive detail of secret service operations for Papa's own concise prose. But the web of conspiracy Simmons spins, the zesty characters it entangles and its intricate cross-weave of fact and fiction distinguish this celebration of the Hemingway centenary. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Adobe Photoshop Restoration &amp; Retouching</h2><p>Whether you&#x2019;re a professional photographer or the family shutterbug, you can&#x2019;t afford to miss the third edition of the now classic Photoshop Restoration &amp; Retouching.

Not merely regarded as a Hollywood playground, golf enclave, or retirement mecca, Palm Springs is also a bastion of idiosyncratic modernism that is unparalleled in the world. Creating stunning homes and an impressive array of other buildings in the middle of the desert, such masters as Albert Frey, Richard Neutra, John Lautner, R. M. Schindler, Donald Wexler, and Lloyd Wright exercised their creative potential there. Palm Springs Weekend explores everything from the grandiose, such as Neutra&#39;s Kaufmann house, to the more humble features of the city--motels, trailer homes, and the ubiquitous metal and concrete sunscreens that shade them. Filled with hundreds of archival and contemporary photographs, elevations, and vintage ephemera, Palm Springs Weekend reveals an inimitable city where modern design, Hollywood glamour, and the desolate drama of the desert coalesce.</p><p><i>Palm Springs Weekend</i> could have been just a breezy look at the celebrity culture of this California desert playground. Instead, Alan Hess offers an authoritative yet refreshingly nondoctrinaire view of the various ways European and American architects--some famous, some not--adapted the canons of modernism to suit the desert climate, landscape, and lifestyle. With evocative vintage photographs and an engagingly retro design by Andrew Danish, this is one of the most enjoyable popular architecture books in years.<p> The story begins with "the panorama of brown rock... peppered with ever-changing shadows and the unexpected desert plants that turn this great natural wall into a tapestry of texture and color." Then came the wealthy industrialists and Hollywood royalty who wanted vacation homes and were more or--at least initially--less amenable to modern design. Car culture and casual living morphed the international style into new silhouettes and textures fit for a modern oasis.</p><p> Swiss �migr� Albert Frey designed minimalist houses "like tents staked in the desert." Richard Neutra's famous Kaufmann House has polished glass walls, flat, floating roofs, and luxury finishes, while John Lautner's Elrod House--seen in the James Bond film <i>Diamonds Are Forever</i>--is a futuristic concrete cave. Tract homes by William Krisel and Dan Palmer for the Alexander Company offered a mass-market modernist solution, with butterfly roofs and patterned concrete block walls crisply defined by the intense sun.</p><p> By the early '50s, local projects also included civic and commercial buildings. Memorable nonresidential projects range from William Cody's Huddle Springs restaurant, with its bold angled beams, canvas awnings, and open plan, to Victor Gruen's City National Bank, on which a sweeping curved roof reminiscent of Le Corbusier's Ronchamp chapel meets the desert opulence of gold filigree. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>Andrew Danish an art director and designer, and principal of Danish Modern.

UP.</p><p>Remembered in standard history texts as an adventurer who helped extend England's maritime empire to the coasts of Africa and the Americas, Francis Drake roamed the world under the patronage of Queen Elizabeth I. He enriched her coffers by attacking Spanish merchant ships in the Caribbean, raiding ports, looting churches, and taking a cut of the slave trade--the acts not of a military man, Harry Kelsey argues, but of a pirate, and of a cowardly one at that as he was given to fleeing at the first sign of danger, leaving his men behind. Even so, for his services Elizabeth awarded Drake a knighthood and a degree of immunity until he failed to appear at his post during a naval engagement against ships of the Spanish armada. He then lost the queen's favor and disappeared from history's stage. Drake has few champions today, certainly fewer than he did in Elizabethan times. Even then he was none too popular. This well-written revisionist biography explains why. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>In this new biography, Harry Kelsey shatters the familiar image of Sir Francis Drake. The Drake of legend was a pious, brave, and just seaman who initiated the move to make England a great naval power and whose acts of piracy against his country&#39;s enemies earned him a knighthood for patriotism. Kelsey paints a different and far more interesting picture of Drake as an amoral privateer at least as interested in lining his pockets with Spanish booty as in forwarding the political goals of his country, a man who became a captain general of the English navy but never waged traditional warfare with any success.</p><h2>Comparative Politics</h2><p><p>Debuting in its first edition and driven by a question-based approach, <i>Comparative Politics</i> shows readers how to do real comparative analysis while introducing them to political institutions, identities, and interests. This thematic survey uniquely balances the <i>how</i>&#x2013;analytical knowledge&#x2013;and the <i>what</i>&#x2013;descriptive knowledge&#x2013;to help readers make their own political arguments and to thus be more critically informed and engaged political participants. </p></p><p><b>David J.

They address many of my concerns with existing texts by providing instructors with a great deal of leeway in designing a syllabus. Each case study is written by a prominent scholar or rising comparativist and is nicely linked to the thematic survey. This would allow me the flexibility of using a different survey text or no survey text at all.&#x201d;&#x2013;Emmanuel Teitelbaum, George Washington University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have looked at many comparative politics textbooks and none of them have appealed to me the way that this one did right away. Some aim too high and ask far too much of students, losing them in a sea of concepts with few tools to make sense of them. Others aim too low and ask far too little of students, failing to challenge them on the essential themes and concepts of comparative politics. This one finds the middle ground by presenting topics in an interesting and engaging manner and challenging students to cultivate their analytical skills.&#x201d;&#x2013;Katy Crossley-Frolick, Denison University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuels helps students make sense of complex theoretical questions and approaches, and he applies them very effectively to case examples. This textbook beats all the alternatives; it is very well thought-out.&#x201d;&#x2013;Kenneth Roberts, Cornell University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Samuels engages professors as well as students by making our field accessible without compromising the curiosities and complexities that make it so interesting. The study of institutions, interests, and identities introduces undergraduates to the politics of countries in the world through a rigorous lens of comparative analysis. Samuels raises the most interesting questions and puzzles within our field and guides the student through the methods of comparative politics science. To have a textbook that moves beyond a list of concepts and an historical chronology of countries is immensely satisfying.&#x201d;&#x2013;Lauretta Frederking, University of Portland</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am delighted that the author recognizes how graduate-level comparative political scientists are trained and that he has brought this approach to the undergraduate level. This is useful training not only for budding comparative politics students but for those who seek to become informed world citizens.&#x201d;&#x2013;Jennifer White, University of Georgia</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;<i>Comparative Politics</i> is a theory-centered introductory text that perfectly balances the substantive nature of our field with the level of accessibility necessary for an undergraduate class.&#x201d;&#x2013;Julie Mazzei, Kent State University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuels provides a strong introduction to the themes, concepts, and current debates of comparative politics without burying the reader in a mound of empirical details. It encourages hypothesis testing, fosters students&#x2019; critical thinking skills, and encourages students to place current political developments in context.&#x201d;&#x2013;John Scherpereel, James Madison University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;I am impressed that Samuels does not shy away from introducing students to the major debates in comparative politics and having them evaluate competing arguments. In trying to get the students to think theoretically, he has definitely chosen an approach that will challenge the best students.&#x201d;&#x2013;Steve Barracca, Eastern Kentucky University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This is a readable and well-organized exploration of major topics in comparative politics that brings together basic as well as more advanced topics. It provides students with examples of how to actually do comparative politics and prompts them to think through the major arguments of the field.&#x201d;&#x2013;Wendy N. Whitman Cobb, Santa Fe College</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuels does a better job than any I have seen of discussing key themes in comparative politics in an intelligent and well-written way. He raises the big questions in a straightforward and engaged manner, and he does a good job of addressing them in comparative perspective with the American institutions that my students know well.&#x201d;&#x2013;Kevin Deegan-Krause, Wayne State University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Samuels offers students a theoretically robust yet highly accessible introduction to the study of comparative politics. He clearly introduces core concepts and theories, offering compelling examples that encourage students to think through different ways of answering fundamental questions that define the field. I&#x2019;m thrilled to see the strong focus on political identity in an introductory textbook.&#x201d;&#x2013;James Ross, University of Northern Colorado</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;This work is thoughtfully and freshly conceived and focuses on a straightforward analysis of political outcomes instead of rehashing historical debates in comparative politics that are not germane to students just coming to the topic. David Samuels writes with an enthusiasm that will entice students, and his emphasis on comparative politics as a puzzle is something that I would like my students to assimilate.&#x201d;&#x2013;David Levenbach, Arkansas State University</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;David Samuel&#x2019;s innovative thematic survey and country casebook stand out as the most comprehensive material for introductory comparative politics courses.

Clooney, S.J., Director of the Center for the Study of World Religions, Harvard University</b></p><p>Bhakti yoga has been by far the most common form of yoga practiced in India for more than two millennia. Although The Yoga Sutras of Pata�jali has become the canonical text for yoga philosophy and practice in the West, few in India either presently or historically have actually read or even know about it. Most Hindus across the centuries have gained their yoga philosophy from the stories of great yogi exemplars found in the bhakti literature of the subcontinent.</p><p>In simplest terms, bhakti is the heartfelt practice of love and devotion to God. In Western yoga circles, the term is often associated with the increasingly popular practice of kirtana, or chanting in a group or at large gatherings. But bhakti yoga is far more complex and ancient, and embraces many strands and practices. Edwin F. Bryant focuses on one important school of bhakti as a way into understanding this practice in general. He explores a Krsna tradition in depth to show what bhakti is and how it is expressed. He supplies his own translations of central texts from the tradition in the form of tales and teachings drawn from arguably the most influential text on bhakti, called the Bhagavata Purana, or the Beautiful Legend of God. And he compares and contrasts them with the bhakti practices outlined in <i>The Yoga Sutras of Pata�jali</i>. </p><p>This clarifying study establishes a baseline for understanding bhakti yoga, and will be welcomed by students and devotees of the spiritual heritage of India.</p><p><b>Features of this new edition:</b><br>-An extensive introduction to the definition and practices of bhakti<br>-Original Translations of key tales and teachings from the Bhagavata Purana<br>-Translations of some of the popular stories from Krsna&#x2019;s incarnation<br>-Translation of the Bhakti Sutras<br>-Translation of the <i>Siksastakam</i>, the eight instructional verses on bhakti by Caitanya Mahaprabhu<br>-An essay on the Purana and Vedic literature<br>-A glossary, endnotes, and a bibliography</p></p><p><b>Edwin F.

Exner, Jr. The second volume in John E. Exner&#x2019;s groundbreaking work, this book is devoted to advanced scoring and interpretation, including structural assessment, content assessment, and diagnosis and prediction, as well as special issues relating to specifics of interpretation for various pathological conditions. This revised and expanded Second Edition includes findings from more than 300 studies involving more than 12,000 subjects&#x2014;including young and old, patients and nonpatients&#x2014;conducted since 1982. Also new to this edition are a chapter on simulation and malingering and one on issues in researching the test. 1991 (0 471-85080-2) 476 pp. The Rorschach A Comprehensive System Volume 3: Assessment of Children and Adolescents John E. Exner, Jr. and Irving B. Weiner The third volume in this highly successful series offers practitioners a single source to the essential interpretive skills for establishing accurate psychological descriptions of younger clients using the Rorschach Test. Data collected from more than 1,800 non-patient children&#x2014;ages 5 through 16&#x2014;provides a solid normative base for interpretation. Nineteen case studies demonstrate the use of the test for personality description, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning in cases involving schizophrenia, depression, and learning and behavior problems. 1982 (0 471-09364-5) 449 pp. Handbook of Psychological Assessment Second Edition Gary Groth-Marnat Offers step-by-step guidance to the selection, administration, evaluation, and interpretation of the WlSC-R and WAIS-R; Bender Visual Motor Gestalt; MMPI/MMPI-2; TAT; Rorschach; CPI; and projective drawings. It also offers a rational approach to integrating test results, interview data, and behavioral measurements into a psychological report. New to this edition are chapters on the context of clinical assessment; interview techniques; behavioral assessment; a review of the MMPI-2 (revised); a new scoring system for the Bender Visual Motor Gestalt Test; a section on clinical judgment; and more. 1990 (0 471-51034-3) 594 pp.</p><p>The Rorschach: A Comprehensive System Volume 1: Basic Foundations Third Edition The name of John Exner is familiar to every clinician who uses the Rorschach Test. His monumental undertaking of integrating the empirically defensible components of the five predominant Rorschach Systems (the Beck, Klopfer, Hertz, Piotrowski, and Schafer systems) into a unified Comprehensive System has, in the words of one reviewer, "injected new life into the aging Rorschach." As a consequence, in the two decades since the publication of the first edition of this groundbreaking work, Exner&#x2019;s Comprehensive System has become the most widely used approach to the test. Volume 1 of The Rorschach serves as a basic introduction to the Rorschach inkblot test and focuses on its administration, scoring and interpretation according to the Comprehensive System. This new Third Edition reflects an amplification of the many refinements to the System covered in its predecessor, published in 1986. Approximately twenty percent larger than its predecessor, the Third Edition encompasses new normative data for both adults and children, patients and non-patients. While the overall format has remained the same, this edition includes eight new chapters. Volume 1 of The Rorschach is divided into five parts. Part 1 offers an historical overview of Rorschach. Part 2 shows how to administer and score the test. Part 3 comprises working tables necessary for accurate scoring and interpretation. Part 4 deals with the principles of interpretations, and reviews important literature on the significance of the test&#x2019;s components. And Part 5 contains protocols which illustrate a variety of examples and shows how the test may be used for each. Integrating positive findings from more than 400 studies involving more than 12,000 subjects into a system which is easily taught, manifests high interclinician reliability, and stands well against the various tests of its validity, this book is an essential resource for clinical, counseling and industrial psychologists, as well as school psychologists and personality theorists.About the author JOHN E. EXNER, JR., PhD, is Professor Emeritus in Psychology, Long Island University, New York. During more than 30 years of teaching he was integral to the formation of doctoral programs in psychology at Bowling Green State University and Long Island University. In 1968 he founded and continues as the Executive Director of the Rorschach Research Foundation (Rorschach Workshops).

While the book starts with a three-day menu called "Begin-Your-Diet Menus," followed by recipes, there is no shopping list for this section, and not even a pantry section for the rest of the book to aid calorie-watchers in preparing themselves for myriad recipes, the possible advent of binging and the potential for last-minute guests. Unquestionably ingenious calorie- and fat-saving recipes can be found--among them, no- cholesterol brownie bits and taco salad using corn tortillas pressed and then baked--not fried--into a custard cup mold. However, the calorie counts, included prominently with each recipe, can be deceiving; no measurements are given for serving sizes. Moreover, there are inconsistencies.

I sat in on a panel made up of widely published nonfiction writers, prepared to team a thing or two. Before the readings, they discussed the genre. One of them said cheerfully, "Just what is creative nonfiction? Who knows? I guess it includes just about everything." </p> <p> I wouldn't have minded if the statement had been made at a gathering of electrical engineers. They have their area of expertise and we writers have ours. But these panelists were writers. Experts. We came to hear them, pencils in hand. If electrical engineers were that careless about their trade, there would be fires all over town. </p> <p> Clearly, a textbook was called for. The book, I decided, should explain why creative or literary nonfiction is different from utilitarian nonfiction. Significantly and definably different. That would be step one. The book should help students to examine literary nonfiction with the care it deserves. It should guide them in the art of close reading, their key to writing fresh and insightful literary nonfiction on their own. </p> <p> My hope was to write an anti-textbook textbook. That is, a work that would persuade readers that the most effective study of literary nonfiction is literary nonfiction itself. Why write a book that challenges its own existence? Because not all students have mastered the art of close reading, and because without that rewarding and essential ability, they may find it difficult to improve their writing on their own. </p> <p> There is a kissing-cousin relationship between this volume and my other textbook, <i>Three Genres: The Writing of Poetry, Fiction, and Drama,</i> also published by Prentice Hall. Or perhaps they are more like grandfather and grandson. Three Genres has been in print for close to 40 years and is now in its seventh edition. For a while I was tempted to include literary nonfiction in that text, replacing the drama section. But the demand for a nonfiction text seemed too great for such an amalgamation. </p> <p> Here's the approach. Part One has eight chapters that define the genre, describing its various forms and giving advice on how to establish a focus and a sense of structure. There is an important chapter on literary aspects, those pleasurable elements generally ignored in utilitarian prose. Another chapter deals with ethical concerns: what is right by everyone's standards, what's in the gray zone, and what is just dead wrong and can land one in jail. The final chapter in this section deals with how to read. Why does this come last? Because it takes that long to persuade many readers that they're probably missing much of the subtly and beauty of literary writing. </p> <p> Part Two includes 14 contemporary essays. They have been selected to illustrate different types of literary nonfiction, such as personal experience, the biographical sketch, opinion pieces, a sense of place, and the like. Eight of these essays are analyzed to help students see how the work approaches that kind of essay. </p> <p> The other six essays are marked "For discussion." That means I have, with admirable restraint, kept quiet. My only guidance is a brief introduction entitled "What to look for." Students will have read one or two somewhat similar essays; now they are being asked to do their own analysis. I want to encourage students to read analytically on their own. Once they can do that, they will have the power and ability to discover their own unique voices. </p> <p> Although I have been describing this text as if it were designed for classroom use only, I hope it will be useful for those many individuals who are not presently taking a course. For them, essays marked "For discussion" can be thought of as "For thoughtful examination." Those who keep literary journals will benefit from writing down their own analysis and insights. </p> <p> The essays vary greatly. Some are the work of distinguished and widely published authors; others, as you can see in "Notes on Contributors," have not published widely. I want to assure students that it is possible to write effective and even publishable nonfiction at any age. In addition, some essays are fairly straightforward, and others make use of flashbacks and symbolic elements. Each essay, however, illustrates a particular type of literary nonfiction, and each has elements well worth studying. </p> <p> The writers included here represent a variety of racial and ethnic backgrounds. Students should know that literary nonfiction provides a dual function for minorities. It can help to define the cultural heritage for fellow members, and it can explain those traditions and values to the larger community. </p> <p> I have always enjoyed contact with instructors, students, and writers through e-mail. I hope to continue this tradition with readers of this text. My e-mail address is s.minot@juno.com. We are also preparing a Web site under the name of threegenres.com. Writers are a scattered tribe, especially in the United States, and we owe it to ourselves to create a virtual community through the Internet. </p> <p> I owe special thanks to my wife, Virginia, whose artwork graces the cover of this text as well as that of the seventh edition of <i>Three Genres.</i> In addition, I am grateful for the enthusiasm and assistance of Carrie Brandon and Maureen Benicasa at Prentice Hall. Of the many individuals who nominated essays for this text, I am particularly grateful to my colleagues Chris Buckley and Tom Morton and also to Dick Dreselly of Brunswick, Maine. I look forward to hearing from those who use this text. </p> <p> <i>Stephen Minot</i> <br> s.minot@juno.com </p></p><h2>Philosophical Ethics: An Historical And Contemporary Introduction (Dimensions of Philosophy)</h2><p>This book shows how Hobbes, Mill, Kant, Aristotle, and Nietzsche all did ethical philosophy?

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the <strong>Global Music Series</strong>. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br> <em>Music in South India</em> provides a vivid and focused introduction to the musical landscape of South India, discussing historical and contemporary performance, cultural history and geography, and the social organization of performance traditions. The book centers on Karnatak concert music, a unique performance practice that juxtaposes gorgeous musical compositions with many different types of improvisation. T. Viswanathan and Matthew Harp Allen first compare two types of song--<em>bhajan</em>, a structurally simple devotional genre, and <em>kriti</em>, the primary concert genre--and also analyze <em>raga</em> and <em>tala</em>, the basic elements underlying Karnatak music. They go on to examine the evolution of Karnatak music during the twentieth century, paying special attention to gender and caste and illuminating these issues through case studies and historical recordings (on the accompanying CD) of a small group of enormously influential musicians. In the final chapter, the authors move beyond Karnatak music to address other aspects of South India's rich musical environment, such as its thriving popular music scene (based on cinema music); regional traditions ranging from the sacred to the secular, many of which integrate elements from dance and drama; and contemporary composition. <br> Featuring numerous listening activities, <em>Music in South India</em> is packaged with an 80-minute CD containing examples of the music discussed. The CD includes a full, uncut concert recording of a <em>kriti</em> performance, which shows how Karnatak musicians weave together composed and improvised elements to create extended performances.<br></p><p>The late Tanjore Viswanathan was a Professor Music at Wesleyan University.

On that Saturday afternoon, four days after the Allied landings in Normandy, SS troops encircled the town in the rolling farm country of the Limousin. Soldiers marched the men to nearby barns, lined them up, and shot them. They then locked the women and children in the church, shot them, and set the building and the rest of the town on fire. Residents who had been away for the day returned to a blackened scene of horror, carnage, and devastation.<br><br>In 1946 the French State expropriated and preserved the entire ruins of Oradour. The forty acres of crumbling houses, farms and shops became France's <i>village martyr</i>, set up as a monument to French suffering under the German occupation. Today, the village is a tourist destination, complete with maps and guidebooks.<br><br>In this first full-scale study of the destruction of Oradour and its remembrance over the half century since the war, Sarah Farmer investigates the prominence of the massacre in French understanding of the national experience under German domination. Through interviews with survivors and village officials, as well as extensive archival research, she pieces together a fascinating history of both a shattering event and its memorial afterlife.<br><br>Complemented by haunting photographs of the site, Farmer's eloquent dissection of France's national memory addresses the personal and private ways in which, through remembrance, people try to come to terms with enormous loss. <i>Martyred Village</i> will have implications for the study of the history and sociology of memory, testimonies about remembrances of war and the Holocaust, and postmodern concerns with the presentation of the past.</p><p><i>"Four days after the Allied landings in Normandy, SS troops encircled the town of Oradour in the rolling farm country of the Limousin and rounded up its inhabitants. In the marketplace they divided the men from the women and children. The men were marched off to barns nearby and shot. The soldiers locked the women and children in the church, shot them, and set the building (and the rest of the town) on fire. Those residents of Oradour who had been away for the day, or had managed to escape the roundup, returned to a blackened scene of horror, carnage, and devastation."</i><p> University of Iowa history professor Sarah Farmer's <i>Martyred Village</i> is not, however, a book about that massacre, but about how the French people have chosen to remember it in the years since. How did the massacre at Oradour become a symbol for the French experience at the hands of the occupying German forces? What went into the decision to create no monument to the dead but to allow the ruined husk of a village to remain as permanent testimony to what happened? And what do visitors to those ruins experience when they go there today? How have the residents of the "new town," adjacent to the scene, dealt with their position? These are some of the questions that Farmer addresses in her precise examination of the relationship between individual remembrances and the collective commemorations of history.</p><b>Sarah Farmer</b> is Associate Professor of History, University of Iowa, and author of <i>Oradour: Arr�t sur m�moire</i>, published in France in 1994.</p><h2>Business Law: The Ethical, Global, and E-Commerce Environment</h2><p>This is the 17th UCC Edition (and the twenty-second overall edition) of a business law text that first appeared in 1935. Throughout its 80 years of existence, this book has been a leader and an innovator in the fields of business law and the legal environment of business. One reason for the book&#x2019;s success is its clear and comprehensive treatment of the standard topics that form the traditional business law curriculum. Another reason is its responsiveness to changes in these traditional subjects and to new views about that curriculum. In 1976, this textbook was the first to inject regulatory materials into a business law textbook, defining the &#x201c;legal environment&#x201d; approach to business law. Over the years, this textbook has also pioneered by introducing materials on business ethics, corporate social responsibility, global legal issues, and e-commerce law.

Neal Loving never met an obstacle that he couldn't overcome. In this memoir, he describes in astounding detail his journey through the racially discriminatory world of aviation in the 1930s, a crippling glider accident in 1944, and life as a successful aviation educator and engineer. Born in Detroit in 1916 to a middle-class African-American family, Loving early developed a fondess for aviation. Though discouraged from trying to break through the prevailing prejudices, he forged ahead and became one of several African-Americans aviators. In 1944, he lost both of his legs in a glider accident that laid him up in a hospital for several months. Simultaneously, his fianc&#x201a;e left him and his mother died. On artificial legs, he rebuilt his life and took once again to the air. By the end of the story, he has successfully designed and built his own aircraft, the Love, opened an aviation school, married a woman from Jamaica, become an aeronautical engineer, and worked at the highest levels of aviation safety. Throughout, Loving limns the challenges of both de facto and de jure segregation and paints portraits of the many people who defied those obstacles to become successful pilots. Written in unadorned, straightforward prose, this memoir is a testament to human fortitude, courage, and joy. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>In his memoir Loving emerges as a person of extraordinary ability with an unwavering faith in a dream and an almost fanatic work ethic. He spent his adolescence in Depression-era Detroit where he learned to fly at a time when blacks were not even admitted to many airports. In 1944 he lost both legs in the crash of a glider he had designed. He then ran a flying school and designed and built the one-seater racing plane he nicknamed "Loving's Love," which is being restored for permanent display at the Experimental Aircraft Association's Air Education Museum in Wisconsin. Loving also studied aeronautical engineering at Wayne State and, on graduation, worked for 20 years as an aerospace research engineer. Although he relates his numerous experiences with racism, he nevertheless seems to have found both his personal life and his career thoroughly satisfying.

The Hebrew language of the Bible must be understood from its original and Ancient Hebrew perspective. Our interpretation of a word like "holy" is an abstract idea, derived out of a Greco-Roman culture and mindset, which is usually understood as someone or something that is especially godly, pious or spiritual. However, the Hebrew word &#x5e7;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9; (qadosh) means, from an Ancient Hebrew perspective, unique and is defined in this dictionary as: "Someone or something that has, or has been given the quality of specialness, and has been separated from the rest for a special purpose." With this interpretation, we discover that the nation of Israel is not "holy," in the sense of godliness or piety, but is a unique and special people, separated from all others to serve God. This Biblical Hebrew dictionary contains the one thousand most frequent verbs and nouns found within the Hebrew Bible. Each word is translated and defined from its original concrete Ancient Hebrew perspective, allowing for a more accurate interpretation of the text. In addition to the one thousand verbs and nouns, the appendices in the book include a complete list of Hebrew pronouns, prepositions, adverbs, conjunctions and numbers.</p><p></p><h2>The Unknown Matisse: A Life of Henri Matisse, Volume 1: The Early Years, 1869-1908</h2><p>Hilary Spurling presents a thorough and riveting account of Matisse&#39;s early life, from his beginnings as the son of shopkeepers in Flanders through his impoverished days as a student at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts.

Set in magical, mysterious India, these tales of people and animals living together--though not always harmoniously--in the world of nature have appealed equally to children and adults since their first appearance more than a century ago. Most focus on Mowgli, a boy raised by wolves. As Baloo the sleepy brown bear, Bagheera the cunning black panther, Kaa the python, and his other animal friends teach their beloved man-cub&#x201d; the ways of the jungle, Mowgli gains the strength and wisdom he needs for his frightful fight with Shere Khan, the tiger who robbed him of his human family. But there are also the tales of Rikki-tikki-tavi the mongoose and his great war&#x201d; against the vicious cobras Nag and Nagaina; of Toomai, who watches the elephants dance; and of Kotick the white seal, who swims in the Bering Sea. This edition includes both the original <i>Jungle Book</i> (1894) and <i>The Second Jungle Book</i> (1895), written in response to the original&#x2019;s enormous success.<br><br></p><p><b>Lisa Makman</b> is visiting Assistant Professor of English at the University of Michigan.

Her teaching and research focus on Victorian culture and children&#x2019;s and adolescent literature.<br><b>From Lisa Makman&#x2019;s Introduction to <i>The Jungle Books</i><br><br></b><p>Like his contemporary, American animal fabulist Joel Chandler Harris, whose Uncle Remus&#x201d; stories were popular in England in the 1880s, Kipling told animal stories that diverged from the tradition of moral English and American animal tales. In <i>The Jungle Books</i> Kipling generates a new breed of animal tale, one that combines the didacticism of earlier English animal stories with a new vision of nature influenced in part by the popularization of Charles Darwin&#x2019;s ideas following the appearance of the groundbreaking <i>On the Origin of Species</i> (1859). The wolves that populate the Mowgli stories are not the denizens of Grimm&#x2019;s fairytales or Aesop&#x2019;s fables that is, expressions of human foibles. They are unabashedly lupine: more hungry hunters than crafty deceivers of girls in red capes. Their primary focus in life is food, and food for them means frequent hunting. The Mowgli stories chime with the refrain good hunting&#x201d; the phrase with which animals who follow what Kipling calls Jungle Law&#x201d; hail their fellows. Most of the numerous songs&#x201d; in the books deal with hunting or with another sort of violence. The animals in <i>The Jungle Books</i> (and, in places, the humans) don&#x2019;t only discuss hunting they do it. They do so much of it that Henry James, a lone critical voice when the books first appeared, remarked in a letter to Edmund Gosse: The violence of it all, the almost exclusive preoccupation with fighting and killing, is . . . singularly characteristic.&#x201d;</p><p>Kipling&#x2019;s wolves do, however, adhere to a strict code of ethical behavior, which Mowgli and the hypothetical child reader learn. The violence in the books is tempered by this code of Jungle Law. In fact, what is most striking about Kipling&#x2019;s depiction of nature is that it is not a place of wild savagery but of sensible adherence to this law. For the Law of the Jungle is not simply a Darwinian survival of the fittest,&#x201d; but rather a complex set of precepts by which a society regulates its members. Kipling uses nature metaphors to describe the Law, suggesting that it simply grows in the jungle, like a plant: As the creeper that girdles the tree-trunk the Law runneth forward and back / For the strength of the Pack is the Wolf, and the strength of the Wolf is the Pack.&#x201d; The Law clearly girdles&#x201d; the pack, and as the stories show, it links together all the animals of the jungle. It seems that the Law compels the creatures to act in consort, like a single animal. In fact, the poem or song in which it is described, The Law of the Jungle,&#x201d; concludes with an image of the Law as a single beast. These lines also serve as an epigraph for <i>The Second Jungle Book</i>: Now these are the Laws of the Jungle, and many and mighty are they; But the head and the hoof of the Law and the haunch and the hump is Obey!&#x201d; For Kipling, the central precept of this law, which establishes and maintains the social order, is submission.</p><p>Law is specifically contrasted with savagery in the story with which Kipling concludes the first <i>Jungle Book</i>, Her Majesty&#x2019;s Servants.&#x201d; Here the law that is followed by animals has been created by men the British military in India and the rule of the British is glorified. In this story the narrator recounts a conversation among animals that he overhears on a night passed in a military camp where the Viceroy of India is meeting with the Amir of Afghanistan. As a young journalist, Kipling himself attended such an event. In the story, the Amir, described as a wild king of a very wild country,&#x201d; has brought with him an entourage of savage men and savage horses.&#x201d; Her Majesty&#x2019;s Servants,&#x201d; animals who serve England, grumble about these uncultivated horses who stampede each night through the camp, disrupting their sleep. Throughout the narrative, various beasts speak in turn about how they fight for the British in colonial wars, each asserting that his manner in battle is best. When a youthful mule asks why the beasts must fight at all, the troop-horse, who has been established as a superior fighting animal and servant,&#x201d; responds, Because we are told to.&#x201d; This story and the first <i>Jungle Book</i> as a whole conclude with a clear message: Obey orders and all will be well. At the end of the tale, the narrator listens to another conversation, this time between a native officer&#x201d; and a Central Asian chief, who watch 30,000 British soldiers and their animals parade for the Amir, among them the beasts overheard on the previous night. When the chief marvels at the obedience of the men and animals, asking, In what manner was this wonderful thing done?&#x201d; the officer responds, There was an order, and they obeyed.&#x201d; The story is then punctuated with the Parade-Song of the Camp Animals&#x201d;: The animals sing, Children of the Camp are we, / Serving each in his degree.&#x201d; All in all, the lawlessness of savage&#x201d; beasts is contrasted with the orderly hierarchy of English-trained animals. Creatures ruled by the English are presented as models of self-regulation and submission. The animals seem to stand in for the Indian people whom the British govern. The rule and the Law of the English is thus hailed without ambivalence. This celebration of British rule in India can be seen in other <i>Jungle Book</i> stories as well, such as The Undertakers&#x201d; and Letting in the Jungle.&#x201d;<br></p></p><h2>The Psychology of Humor: An Integrative Approach</h2><p><p>Research on humor is carried out in a number of areas in psychology, including the cognitive (What makes something funny?), developmental (when do we develop a sense of humor?), and social (how is humor used in social interactions?)

Professor Fry therefore first takes the reader through the various stages of the speech chain: from language units to nerve impulses to muscle movements to sound waves, and vice versa as the message is received and decoded. He then explains the basic physical principles involved in the generation and propagation of sound energy and in the phenomenon of resonance. These principles are then applied to the speech mechanism itself and to the particular kinds of sound which constitute speech. There is a fully illustrated account of the use of the sound spectrograph in acoustic analysis and chapters dealing with the acoustic features of English sounds and with the way we recognise speech sounds by the acoustic cues inherent in a particular language. Professor Fry gave courses on the physics of speech to students of applied as well as theoretical linguistics and to speech therapists, and his clear account will therefore provide a basic textbook for such courses as well as being of interest to people working in departments of speech and in communications generally.</p><p>A clear account of the physical process of speech production and communication, which will be of interest to psycholinguists as well as phoneticians.Professor Fry first takes the reader through the various stages of the speech chain: from language units to nerve impulses to muscle movements to sound waves, and vice versa as the message is received and decoded.

Margaret Hale is initially appalled by the unrefined town of Milton and its population of factory workers. But after befriending a local family, she develops a sense of sympathy for the struggles of the poor. The demands of Margaret's awakening social conscience are further challenged by her attraction to John Thornton, self-made man and wealthy factory owner.<br>Praised by Charles Dickens as an "admirable story, full of character and power," Elizabeth Gaskell's 1855 novel unfolds across the social divides of a changing world. The romance between the haughty but sensitive heroine and an intelligent, dynamic man of lower social status touches upon political, philosophical, and economic issues. An unflinching depiction of the bleak conditions of the working poor as well as a commentary on the mid-Victorian era's class conflicts, this richly textured tale raises timeless questions about the nature of social authority and protest.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.From her home ground, her father&#39;s comfortably middle-class living in Hampshire and her aunt&#39;s establishment in Harley Street, Margaret is exiled to the ugly northern industrial town of Milton. Surprisingly, her social consciousness awakens. It is intensified by a relationship with the local mill-owner, Thornton, that combines passionate attraction with fierce opposition. The novel explores the exploitation of the working class, linking the plight of workers with that of women and probing the myth and reality of the &#39;north-south divide&#39;.</p><h2>Pathophysiology: Concepts and Applications for Health Care Professionals</h2><p>The traditional pathophysiology book is written for the medical student. Nursing and allied health students have simply had to make-do with cumbersome (1500 to 1600 page) books, that assume considerably more science background than the typical allied health student has acquired. The Nowak book is not only briefer (at 700 pages), but is organized in a manner that brings the principles of pathophysiology to the forefront. The authors focus on the relatively few patterns of disease, rather than asking students to memorize extensive catalogues of specific diseases. This conceptual approach is more suited to the allied health student than the disease centred approach featured in the major competitors.</p><p></p><h2>German Big Business and the Rise of Hitler</h2><p>By scrutinizing the major corporate archives of Weimar and Nazi Germany, the author reveals the dynamics between corporations and political machines and locates evidence indicating that big business did not, on balance, support Hitler&#39;s political program</p><p></p><h2>Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics</h2><p>AN AUTHORITATIIVE, UP-TO-DATE INTRODUCTION TO PHYSICAL ACOUSTICS<br> <br> Easy to read and understand, Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics fills a long-standing need for an acoustics text that challenges but does not overpower graduate students in engineering and physics. Mathematical results and physical explanations go hand in hand, and a unique feature of the book is the balance it strikes between time-domain and frequency-domain presentations.<br> <br> Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics is intended for a two-semester, first-year graduate course, but is also suitable for advanced undergraduates. Emphasis on plane waves in the first part of the book keeps the mathematics simple yet accommodates a broad range of topics: propagation, reflection and transmission, normal modes and simple waveguides for rectilinear geometries, horns, inhomogeneous media, and sound absorption and dispersion.<br> <br> The second part of the book is devoted to a more rigorous development of the wave equation, spherical and cylindrical waves (including the more advanced mathematics required), advanced waveguides, baffled piston radiation, diffraction (treated in the time domain), and arrays. Applications and examples are drawn from:<br> * Atmospheric acoustics<br> * Noise control<br> * Underwater acoustics<br> * Engineering acoustics<br> * Acoustical measurements<br> Supplemented with more than 300 graphs and figures as well as copious end-of-chapter problems, Fundamentals of Physical Acoustics is also an excellent professional reference for engineers and scientists.</p><p>DAVID T.

An identification and value guide for a century's worth of collectible American and English jewelry, this title consists of three main sections: "When Was It Made and What Is It Worth?," "100 Years of Cameos," and "Manufacturing Techniques." Each of six chapters in the first section covers a specific time and stylistic period; historical information introduces each of the chapters. The entries provide the date, a brief written description, and the price value of each piece, augmented by more than 1700 photographs, some in color. Prices are either from an auction house, collector, or dealer, with the source used indicated for every entry. Helpful appendixes cover how to date jewelry, distinguish metals, authenticate pieces, and identify designer and trademarks. The unfortunate absence of an index limits access; however, the table of contents is detailed.

Tour.</p><p>The man on the $10 bill is probably the most overlooked Founding Father. This book--not a names-and-dates biography, but an appreciation and assessment in the tradition of Plutarch--should help change that. Richard Brookhiser is an outstanding writer well known for his previous books (especially the wonderful <i>Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington</i>) and journalism (in <i>National Review</i> and the <i>New York Observer</i>); Hamilton could not have asked for a better advocate. A signer of the Constitution and author of roughly two-thirds of the <i>Federalist Papers</i>, Hamilton became the first secretary of the treasury at the age of 32. In this capacity, Brookhiser argues that the scrappy Caribbean native gave birth to American capitalism by developing the country's financial system. Brookhiser also reveals the sex and violence of Hamilton's life: he survived personal scandal but was shot down by Aaron Burr in an 1804 duel. The end came too soon for Hamilton--and it also helped elevate the reputation of his nemesis, Thomas Jefferson. <i>Alexander Hamilton: American</i> is by turns learned, funny, and inspiring. A model of popular biography, it convinces us why we should care deeply about a remarkable man who lived two centuries ago. <i>--John Miller</i><b>Richard Brookhiser</b> is the author of <i>Founding Father: Rediscovering George Washington</i> and <i>The Way of the WASP.</i> He has also edited and annotated Washington's <i>Rules of Civility.</i> He is a Senior Editor at <i>National Review</i> and a <i>New York Observer</i> columnist.

Day"--brought with it the demise of Nazi Germany. But for the Allies, the war was only half-won. Exhausted but exuberant American soldiers, ready to return home, were sent to join the fighting in the Pacific, which by the spring and summer of 1945 had turned into a grueling campaign of bloody attrition against an enemy determined to fight to the last man. Germany had surrendered unconditionally. The Japanese would clearly make the conditions of victory extraordinarily high.<br> <br>Following V-E Day, American citizens understandably clamored for their young men to be shipped back from Europe and longed for a return to a peacetime economy. Politics intruded upon military policy while a new and untested president struggled to control policy. The challenge of defeating the Japanese had come to seem nearly insurmountable. American casualty rates during the previous eighteen months led Army Chief of Staff General George C. Marshall to warn of the toll that "the agony of enduring battle" would likely take. General Douglas MacArthur clashed with Marshall and Admiral Chester Nimitz over strategy. Meanwhile, under pressure, the Army began a program of partial demobilization of troops in Europe, which depleted units at a time when combat-tested soldiers were most needed. In this context of military emergency, the fearsome projections of the human cost of invading the Japanese homeland, and weakening social and political will in the American homeland, seemed to make victory, unconditional or otherwise, an increasingly distant prospect.<br><br>In <em>Implacable Foes</em>, award-winning historians Waldo Heinrichs and Marc Gallicchio bring to life the final year and a half of World War II in the Pacific, combining grand strategy and ground-level account, taking readers from the island-hopping campaigns in the spring of 1944--New Guinea to the Philippines to Okinawa and Iwo Jima--right up to the dropping of the atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Heinrichs and Gallicchio reveal more fully than ever before not only the Japanese policies of desperate defense, but also the sometimes rancorous debates on the home front, and in the process deliver a gripping battle narrative integrated with a provocative and revisionist discussion of American decision-making. The result is a masterful work of military history, one that illuminates both the calculus of global war and the incalculable part played by individual sacrifice.<br></p><p><br><strong>Waldo Heinrichs</strong> is Dwight E.

His inventions, patents, and theoretical work formed the basis of modern AC electricity, and contributed to the development of radio and television. Like his competitor Thomas Edison, Tesla was one of America's first celebrity scientists, enjoying the company of New York high society and dazzling the likes of Mark Twain with his electrical demonstrations. An astute self-promoter and gifted showman, he cultivated a public image of the eccentric genius. Even at the end of his life when he was living in poverty, Tesla still attracted reporters to his annual birthday interview, regaling them with claims that he had invented a particle-beam weapon capable of bringing down enemy aircraft.</p><br><p> Plenty of biographies glamorize Tesla and his eccentricities, but until now none has carefully examined what, how, and why he invented. In this groundbreaking book, W. Bernard Carlson demystifies the legendary inventor, placing him within the cultural and technological context of his time, and focusing on his inventions themselves as well as the creation and maintenance of his celebrity. Drawing on original documents from Tesla's private and public life, Carlson shows how he was an "idealist" inventor who sought the perfect experimental realization of a great idea or principle, and who skillfully sold his inventions to the public through mythmaking and illusion.</p><br><p> This major biography sheds new light on Tesla's visionary approach to invention and the business strategies behind his most important technological breakthroughs.</p></p><p><p>"Carlson has written a serious, rigorous book grounded in the academic history of technology, but also a page-turner that any fan of Tesla will enjoy."<b>--Robert MacDougall, Western University</b></p><p>"Nikola Tesla, like one of his oscillators, flickered between different states so quickly that they can easily blur. Carlson captures this extraordinary, contradictory life--inventor, futurist visionary, showman, and, at times, ranting narcissist. We get to see how Tesla scrambled like mad, built with ambition, and in his later efforts failed monumentally. Here is a book that guides us through this wild ride with empathy and without hagiography."<b>--Peter Galison, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Combining archival research with the latest scholarship from the history of technology, Carlson has written the balanced, scholarly biography that Nikola Tesla has long deserved. This is the definitive study of his life and work."<b>--David E. Nye, University of Southern Denmark</b></p><p>"Most biographies of Tesla lack technical background and are uncritical and adulatory in their approach. Carlson's perspective as a historian--particularly a historian of technology--is indispensable for understanding Tesla's place in the rapidly changing American society of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. His style is engaging and accessible, and the book will clearly be of value to the historical community."<b>--Bernard S. Finn, curator emeritus, Smithsonian Institution</b></p><p>"<i>Tesla</i> is a tour de force of scholarship and analysis. This is the definitive work on Tesla that brings to light much new information about his life, his inventions, and the changing socioeconomic context in which he worked. Carlson has mined the primary sources to an unprecedented depth and breadth. The book is nothing less than extraordinary."<b>--Michael Brian Schiffer, author of<i>Power Struggles: Scientific Authority and the Creation of Practical Electricity before Edison</i></b></p><b>W.

His monthly essays in Natural History magazine were widely read by both scientists and ordinary citizens with an interest in science. One of his books won the National Book Award, and another was a bestseller in three countries. Philosopher Daniel Dennett proclaimed him "America's evolutionist laureate."<br><br>While many people have written about Gould's science, pro and con, and a few have written about his politics, this is the first book to explore his science and politics as a consistent whole. Political scientist David F. Prindle argues that Gould's mind worked along two tracks simultaneously&#x2014;the scientific and the political. All of his concepts and arguments were bona fide contributions to science, but all of them also contained specifically political implications. <br><br>As one example among many, Prindle cites Gould&#x2019;s controversial argument that if the "tape of evolution" could be rewound and then allowed to unspool again, nothing resembling human beings would likely evolve. This was part of his larger thesis that people are not the result of a natural tendency toward perfection in evolution, but the result of chance, or as Gould put it, "contingency." As Prindle notes, Gould&#x2019;s scientific ideas often sought to attack human hubris, and thus prepare the ground for the political argument that people should treat nature with more restraint.<br><br>Prindle evaluates Gould&#x2019;s concepts of punctuated equilibrium (developed with Niles Eldredge), "spandrels," and "exaptation"; his stance on sociobiology, on human inequality and intelligence testing; his pivotal role in the culture wars between science and fundamentalist Christianity; and claims that he was a closet Marxist, which Prindle disputes. He continually emphasizes that in all these debates Gould&#x2019;s science cannot be understood without an understanding of his politics. He concludes by considering whether Gould offered a new theory of evolution.<br><br>Anyone with an interest in one of America&#x2019;s great scientists, or in paleontology, evolutionary theory, or intellectual history will find Stephen Jay Gould and the Politics of Evolution to be a fascinating exploration of the man and his ideas.</p><p>David F.

It constitutes a vast and essential chapter in the history of human health and culture. Ranging from the eating habits of our prehistoric ancestors to food-related policy issues we face today, this work covers the full spectrum of foods that have been hunted, gathered, cultivated, and domesticated; their nutritional make-up and uses; and their impact on cultures and demography. It offers a geographical perspective on the history and culture of food and drink and takes up subjects from food fads, prejudices, and taboos to questions of food toxins, additives, labelling, and entitlements. It culminates in a dictionary that identifies and sketches out brief histories of plant foods mentioned in the text - over 1,000 in all - and additionally supplies thousands of common names and synonyms for those foods.</p><p>Have the French always enjoyed their renowned cuisine? When did Russians begin to eat pirogi? What was the first Indonesian spice to be cultivated elsewhere in the world? Questions such as these make for good <i>Jeopardy</i> material, but they're far from trivial--just ask anyone with a passion for good food and a curiosity for where that food originated. That person will know instinctively that the best way to approach a culture--and, indeed, the human animal--is through the stomach. For this individual, <i>The Cambridge World History of Food</i> will be something of a bible, and the best of gifts. <p> A massive scholarly tome in two volumes and more than 2,000 pages, the <i>CWHF</i> encompasses a wealth of learning that touches on nearly every aspect of human life. (It also reveals the answers to the three earlier questions: No, French cuisine as we know it is a 19th-century development; in the 16th century, following the conquest of the Volga Tatar; ginger, in colonial Mexico.) Thoroughly researched and highly accessible despite its formidable layout, the set addresses a groaning board of topics past and present, from the diet of prehistoric humans to the role of iron in combating disease; from the domestication of animals to the spread of once-isolated ethnic cuisines in a fast-globalizing world. Of greatest interest to general readers is its concluding section--a dictionary of the world's food plants, which gives brief accounts of items both common and exotic, from abalong to Zuttano avocado. </p><p> The product of seven years of research, writing, and editing on the part of more than 200 authors, <i>The Cambridge World History of Food</i> promises to become a standard reference for social scientists, economists, nutritionists, and other scholars--and for cooks and diners seeking to deepen their knowledge of the materials they use and consume. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>From the eating habits of our prehistoric ancestors to food-related policy issues of today, this monumental two-volume work covers the full spectrum of foods that have been hunted, gathered, cultivated, and domesticated; their nutritional make-up and uses; and their impact on cultures and demography.</p><h2>Instructions for American Servicemen in Britain, 1942: Reproduced from the original typescript, War Department, Washington, DC (Instructions for Servicemen)</h2><p>In 1942, the United States War Department distributed a handbook to American servicemen that advised them on the peculiarities of the "British, their country, and their ways." Over sixty years later, this newly published reproduction from the rich archives of the Bodleian Library offers a fascinating glimpse into American military preparations for World War II. <br><br> The guide was intended to alleviate the culture shock for soldiers taking their first trip to Great Britain, or, for that matter, abroad. The handbook is punctuated with endearingly nostalgic advice and refreshingly candid quips such as: "The British don't know how to make a good cup of coffee. You don't know how to make a good cup of tea. It's an even swap." By turns hilarious and poignant, many observations featured in the handbook remain relevant even today. <br><br>Reproduced in a style reminiscent of the era, <i>Instructions for American Servicemen in Britain</i> is a powerfully evocative war-time memento that offers a unique perspective on the longstanding American-British relationship and reveals amusingly incisive American perceptions of the British character and country. <br></p><p>Nick Millea is the Map Librarian at the Bodleian Library.<p>"as much a guide to the American psyche, as to the British...

The holy grail that burns at its core is the snowfly, a legendary insect--enormous, white, and exceedingly rare--that attracts trout of such size that they couldn't possibly exist in the world as we know it. But in <b>The Snowfly</b>, such things can and do exist.<br><br>Bowie Rhodes is a UPI reporter and a fly fisherman of extraordinary talent. He learns of the myth of the snowfly early in his childhood. Legend has it that the giant snowfly hatches every seven to ten years, never on the same river twice. It brings to rise only trout that strain the imagination: trout that are so huge they would have to have lived forty years or more; trout so wily that they never allow themselves to be caught--or even seen--trout so hungry for this fly that they will risk exposure to rise for the hatch. The snowfly is the sacred quest of only the most obsessed trout hunters, and has been seen by no living man or woman, existing only in myth and in a lost manuscript. Rhodes's reporting brings him to the extremes of humanity--in the jungles of Vietnam, in the labyrinth of Brezhnev's Soviet Union, in a poisoned Canadian wasteland of uranium mines.

All kinds of draped cloth, from austere dress to billowing draperies, become in the hands of a gifted artist a dramatic and exciting means to ennoble and sanctify painted figures, to create sensual or erotic effects, and to add drama to narrative. Such was the impact of the artists&#39; particular vision, that life often followed art, and the fashions of a particular era often reflect the pictorial creations of its greatest painters. In his portraits, Van Dyck, for example, created the elegant and aristocratic style which we associate with the court of King Charles I. Depictions of clothed and nude women from different periods show how the aesthetic distortions which governed the representation of women&#39;s fashions extended to the unclothed figure, which is similarly distorted according to current notions of beauty. To illustrate her theme, the author draws on works by artists over a span of six centuries -van der Weyden, Tintoretto, Van Dyck, Reynolds, Gainsborough, Delacroix, Friedrich, Tissot, Vuillard, and Picasso. Fashion plates, photographs, and even film stills are used to show how the issues raised by the depiction of drapery in paintings extend to other media in the modern period.</p><p>This book accompanies an exhibition at the National Gallery, London from June 19 to September 8, 2002.

It then spans the next seventeen years up to the arrival of Ignatius and his early companions in Rome...These years are the central years of Ignatius&#x2019;s life. They are the years...that open with his religious conversion and that witness his spiritual growth. They are the years of pilgrimage, to use his own designation, of active travel and searching, and of interior progress in the Christian life.

Rather, because of its solid foundation in Biblical truth, premillennialism has been a prominent system of interpretation throughout church history. Dr. Ryrie begins this book by introducing systems of interpretation and their vital importance in studying prophecy. He then proceeds to trace how premillennialism has its basis in history, hermeneutics, the Abrahamic covenant, Davidic covenant, new covenant, ecclesiology, and eschatology. Whether you are new to premillennialist teaching, or whether you are interested in a more systematic understanding of its basis in Scripture, the contents of this book will clarify, instruct, and inspire.</p><p>CHARLES C.

In <i>The Leap</i>, Steve Taylor shows that this state is much more common than is generally believed. He shows that ordinary people &#x2015; from all walks of life &#x2015; can and do regularly &#x201c;wake up&#x201d; to a more intense reality, even if they know nothing about spiritual practices and paths. Wakefulness is a more expansive and harmonious state of being that can be cultivated or that can arise accidentally. It may also be a process we are undergoing collectively. Drawing on his years of research as a psychologist and on his own experiences, Taylor provides what is perhaps the clearest psychological study of the state of wakefulness ever published. Above all, he reminds us that it is our most natural state &#x2015; accessible to us all, anytime, anyplace. </p></p><p><p><b>Steve Taylor, PhD,</b> is the author of several books on spirituality and psychology, including <i>The Fall </i>and <i>Waking from Sleep. </i>He has also published two books of poetic spiritual reflections, including <i>The Calm Center</i>.

M. Forster&#39;s Maurice, written in 1914, introduced a new openness about the favorable depiction of homosexuality in English fiction, a number of novels and stories carried coded portraits of homosexuals and homosexuality. Many of these were, by necessity, published privately; still others were written to insure that the homosexual component would be recognizable to a select few; still others embedded homosexual content within such &#34;safe&#34; genres as the Western and the public school novel. There have been several recent anthologies of twentieth-century gay fiction, but David Leavitt and Mark Mitchell&#39;s fascinating book is the first to explore the texts that circulated before the &#34;gay fiction&#34; genre came into being, and before greater tolerance allowed writers to treat homosexual themes directly. Leavitt and Mitchell include extracts from stories and novels by well-known writers such as Herman Melville, Walter Pater, Henry James, Willa Cather, and D. H. Lawrence, as well as work from neglected figures such as Count Eric Stenbock, John Francis Bloxam, &#34;Alan Dale,&#34; and Gerald Hamilton -- the inspiration for Christopher Isherwood&#39;s Mr. Norris. The result is an entertaining and revelatory anthology, and a valuable contribution to our understanding of the literary treatment of homosexuality.</p><p>It was only after the Stonewall riots and the birth of the gay liberation movement in 1969 that the official category "gay writing" came into being. Yet writings by and about lesbians and gay men have a much longer history than that. In <i>Pages Passed from Hand to Hand</i> David Leavitt and Mark Mitchell have charted 200 years of writing about gay men that includes such obscure items as Charlotte Chark's 1755 novel <i>The History of Henry Dumont Esq.</i> and Alan Dale's 1889 <i>A Marriage Below Zero</i> as well as surprisingly homoerotic work by Herman Melville, Henry James, and Ambrose Bierce. While most of these works were already known to serious readers of gay literature, Leavitt and Mitchell's contribution in <i>Pages Passed from Hand to Hand</i> is in consciously placing the material in a clear, unambiguously gay tradition for readers of all sexual persuasions.David Leavitt&#39;s first collection of stories, Family Dancing, was published when he was just twenty-three and was a finalist for both the National Book Critics Circle Award and the PEN/Faulkner Prize. The Lost Language of Cranes was made into a BBC film, and While England Sleeps was short-listed for the Los Angeles Times Fiction Prize. With Mark Mitchell, he coedited The Penguin Book of Short Stories, Pages Passed from Hand to Hand, and cowrote Italian Pleasures. Leavitt is a recipient of fellowships from both the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation and the National Endowment for the Arts. He divides his time between Italy and Florida.</p><h2>The Wizard of Quarks: A Fantasy of Particle Physics</h2><p>Thousands of readers who were delighted by the adventures and science content of Alice in Quantumland are in for another treat.

Fantasy engages the imagination to a much larger extent; the creatures portrayed may come partly or entirely from your head. And yet, to be successful, the scenes from your imagination must be convincing enough for a viewer to be willing to go along with you: to willingly suspend his disbelief and say, <i>"Yes, this could work".</i> </p><p> How does someone begin to create these wholly imaginary pictures? The answer to the eternal question "Where do your ideas come from?" seems obvious at first. Naturally, they come from my head. Where else? Ideas come from one's head. It's true, when you set a manuscript to illustrate, you're likely to find descriptions in it. Still, it is up to the artist to interpret them. All those alien beings and landscapes come into being from what is, in fact, known to us. Existing life may be the point of departure, yet all successful fantastical creatures must relate back to it as traceably as vertebrates do to the single-celled amoeba. Muscles are what makes movement possible for the higher forms of living creatures. If you want to paint a combination animal/machine, let's say, there must still be a relation to existing animals and existing machines; the musculature, at least, must be plausible. </p><p> The immediate environment is a tremendous source of ideas for me: shadows, shapes, things that, as a result of being near-sighted, I don't exactly see. It's pretty easy for me to reinterpret something twenty feet away which is already fuzzy. With a little push it readily loses its real contours and becomes something else in my eyes. If I start elaborating on what I don't clearly see, I can go in any direction. All I need is an existing starting point; my imagination takes over from there. </p><p> This odyssey of the imagination need not be a deliberate or controlled thing. It's much better when it's not directed, when I simply sit quietly and let it happen. In a sense, it's as though my ideas don't come out of me so much as I allow them to move in on me. The most important thing one can do to nourish the imagination is relax. I have noticed that when I specifically try to think of something, really strain towards an idea, very little happens. Whatever does happen is usually stilted and forced. If I relax and open the doors, so to speak, ideas do come. </p><p> Often enough, inspiration begins with the model. I see someone and I think: I would like to use this person for a painting; I would like to focus on this or that special feature of this person. From there I can evolve a character, an atmosphere, or an entire concept. </p><p> I once saw a young man at the gym I go to. He was an excellent bodybuilder, but the more notable quality about him was that he possessed not only huge muscles -- a really fine development -- but also a very boyish, almost child-like face, which presented a striking contrast with his physique. I stored this impression in the back of my mind, hoping that a job would come along for which I could use him. Then I was given a collection of stories by Isaac Asimov. </p><p> My original concept for this book's cover was of a young scientist type sitting on top of the earth in the middle of space. Subsequently I got a call from my client saying that although she liked the sketch, it was not exactly what she had in mind. What did she have in mind? Well, she was rather vague about that, but she preferred something with a more heroic feeling. As we were talking it occurred to me that, instead of emphasizing the human aspect of the stories, I might emphasize the mechanical. </p><p> It was then that I decided to do a robot -- not the typical machine-like robot, but a more human one who would, nevertheless, have a superhuman appearance. At once I made the connection between this idea and the young man I had seen in the gym. The fact that his face was so youthful and his body so highly developed led naturally to the idea of keeping the roundness of the muscles and the distinctive shape of the body but making it metallic, chrome, really beautiful and shiny out there in the middle of space. I still thought of having him standing on the earth, but as I worked, the earth changed into a simple globe. It also became shiny, like glass or chrome. </p><p> So, you see how the concept changed from the sketch of the robot that I started out with to the finished painting. With the use of that man as the model, the robot became an almost superhuman figure, spinning nebulae out of his bare hands. His face is nearly expressionless. Yet there is a suggestion of childlike wonder and joy at what he is doing: there he is in the middle of space, fascinated with the beautiful things he is creating. In this case, the "model" was just perfect, and the concept owed a great deal of its development to his physical characteristics. </p><p> Of course the concept may originate in a more general way than with the model. I may simply think: It would be nice to do something metallic; it would be nice to do something fluffy; it would be nice to do something in which I can concentrate wholly on the figure because the background would be negligible or, vice versa, in which I can concentrate mainly on the background because the figure is inconsequential. </p><p> Most often, however, the concept is established by the manuscript to be illustrated or by the movie for which a poster is to be made -- by the product to be sold. In the case of a book there is, first, the manuscript. There is an old saying that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover. But often enough a book is bought precisely because of its cover. Therefore, as an artist, what one must look for in a manuscript is a scene that is representative of the book, perhaps one with plenty of action or one that is, for its colour or subject, quite eye-catching. After all, there are hundreds of books on the bookstore shelves and the successful cover should draw the prospective buyer like a magnet. </p><p> Some authors are very descriptive and make the task of selecting a visually effective scene relatively easy. <i>The Lavalite World</i> is a good example. It is a book of adventures and consequently presents any number of action scenes involving the hero, the heroine, and the monster or villain. To show the hero and heroine riding a tree trunk into battle was, to my mind, colourful and unusual enough to evoke any browser's interest in the book. </p><p> Some authors are less visual in their writing. They write with less attention to detail and their imagery is more abstract. In such a situation one has to capture a feeling, something representative of the story rather than a particular scene or incident from it. This feeling must then by expressed in visual terms in order to convey an immediate sense of what is going on in the book. My illustrations for <i>Enchantment,</i> which my wife Doris wrote, exemplify this. </p><p> The painting for "Web" does not represent a particular scene from the story. It is simply a depiction of the way I experience a spider woman. I began with the question: What typifies a spider? It has eight legs. But I didn't want to paint a totally unappealing woman with eight hairy legs. I wanted a woman who was sensual and sexy-looking, but at the same time menacing, and who would still evoke the feeling of a spider -- perhaps with a spiderweb around her. </p><p> The painting that was done for <i>Heavy Metal,</i> however, was not inspired by a manuscript or anything more than the title of the magazine itself: HEAVY METAL. I began with the idea of something metal, a heavy metal. A safe came to mind. The door of a safe which, to me, was quite representative both of "metal" and of "heavy". From there followed the image of a bank vault. Yet this was a fantasy painting that I was going to do. What did fantasy have to do with a bank vault? I decided to put it into space; a heavy metal bank vault floating in outer space. Still, something fantastical had to happen. What if something is inside there, I thought. What would have to be locked behind such a door? Some kind of creature, obviously, that has to be kept from escaping. And what if the creature has been pounding at the door? What if the creature has a metal hand that it has been pounding and pounding the door with and has finally broken through? The first picture that flashed through my mind was of some powerful and monstrous creature. But that would have been a bit too ordinary. So I made it incongruous: a kind of wild-looking woman instead of a creature, not all that physically powerful in appearance but with a crazed look. She not only had the metal hand but the wild eyes and the wild red hair. All these elements brought together in a painting should really make the viewer stop and say: Look at that! What's going on there! </p><p> Copyright � Collins &amp; Brown Ltd 1985<br> Text and illustrations copyright � Boris Vallejo 1985</p><p>YA A lovely browsing collection of color reproductions that will appeal to young fantasy fans because of Vallejo's exciting renditions of unearthly creatures and sexy humans.

In this fascinating volume, Jack Copeland rewrites the history of computer science, arguing that in reality Colossus--the giant computer built in Bletchley Park by the British secret service during World War II--predates ENIAC by two years. Until very recently, much about the Colossus machine was shrouded in secrecy, largely because the code-breaking algorithms employed during World War II remained in use by the British security services until a short time ago. Copeland has brought together memoirs of veterans of Bletchley Park--the top-secret headquarters of Britain's secret service--and others who draw on the wealth of declassified information to illuminate the crucial role Colossus played during World War II. A must read for anyone curious about code-breaking or World War II espionage, <em>Colossus</em> offers a fascinating insider's account of the world's first giant computer, the great-great-grandfather of the massive computers used today by the CIA and the National Security Agency.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jack Copeland</strong> is a Reader in Philosophy and Director of the Turing Project at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand.

Moaveni presents the theory of finite element analysis, explores its application as a design/modeling tool, and explains <i>in detail</i> how to use ANSYS intelligently and effectively. Now uses Excel in solving simple finite element problems. Adds a significant number of new problems. Incorporates the latest version of ANSYS throughout. A useful reference for mechanical, civil and environmental engineers.<br> <br></p><p><p> The second edition of <i>Finite Element Analysis,</i> consisting of 15 chapters, includes a number of new features and changes that were incorporated in response to suggestions and requests made by professors, students, and professionals using the first edition of the book. The major features include: </p> <ul> <li>A new comprehensive chapter on matrix algebra</li> <li>A new chapter on beams and frames</li> <li>New sections on axisymmetric elements and formulations</li> <li>A new section on <i>p</i>-method and <i>h</i>-method</li> <li>A new section on unsteady heat transfer</li> <li>A new chapter on dynamic problems</li> <li>A new chapter on design and material selection</li> <li>Two new appendices with properties of area shapes and properties of structural steel shapes</li> <li>A new appendix with examples of batch files</li> <li>A web site to offer additional information for instructors and students</li> </ul> <p> Moreover, a large number of problems have been added, and the property tables have been expanded. I hope you enjoy the second edition. </p> <p> There are many good textbooks already in existence that cover the theory of finite element methods for advanced students. However, none of these books incorporate ANSYS as an integral part of their materials to introduce finite element modeling to undergraduate students and newcomers. In recent years, the use of finite element analysis as a design tool has grown rapidly. Easy-to-use, comprehensive packages such as ANSYS, a general-purpose finite element computer program, have become common tools in the hands of design engineers. Unfortunately, many engineers who lack the proper training or understanding of the underlying concepts have been using these tools. This introductory book is written to assist engineering students and practicing engineers new to the field of finite element modeling to gain a clear understanding of the basic concepts. The text offers insight into the theoretical aspects of finite element analysis and also covers some practical aspects of modeling. Great care has been exercised to avoid overwhelming students with theory, yet enough theoretical background is offered to allow individuals to use ANSYS intelligently and effectively. ANSYS is an integral part of this text. In each chapter, the relevant basic theory is discussed first and demonstrated using simple problems with hand calculations. These problems are followed by examples that are solved using ANSYS. Exercises in the text are also presented in this manner. Some exercises require manual calculations, while others, more complex in nature, require the use of ANSYS. The simpler hand-calculation problems will enhance students' understanding of the concepts by encouraging them to go through the necessary steps in a finite element analysis. Design problems are also included at the end of Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 9 through 14. </p> <p> Various sources of error that can contribute to incorrect results are discussed. A good engineer must always find ways to check the results. While experimental testing of models may be the best way, such testing may be expensive or time consuming. Therefore, whenever possible, throughout this text emphasis is placed on doing a "sanity check" to verify one's finite element analysis (FEA). A section at the end of each appropriate chapter is devoted to possible approaches for verifying ANSYS results. </p> <p> Another unique feature of this book is that the last two chapters are devoted to the introduction of design, material selection, optimization, and parametric programming with ANSYS. </p> <p> The book is organized into 15 chapters. Chapter 1 reviews basic ideas in finite element analysis. Common formulations, such as direct, potential energy, and weighted residual methods are discussed. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive review of matrix algebra. Chapter 3 deals with the analysis of trusses, because trusses offer economical solutions to many engineering structural problems. An overview of the ANSYS program is given in Chapter 3 so that students can begin to use ANSYS right away. Finite element formulation of members under axial loading, beams, and frames are introduced in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 lays the foundation for analysis of one-dimensional problems by introducing one-dimensional linear, quadratic, and cubic elements. Global, local, and natural coordinate systems are also discussed in detail in Chapter 5. An introduction to isoparametric formulation and numerical integration by Gauss-Legendre formulae are also presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 considers Galerkin formulation of one-dimensional heat transfer and fluid problems. Two-dimensional linear and higher order elements are introduced in Chapter 7. Gauss-Legendre formulae for two-dimensional integrals are also presented in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8 the essential capabilities and the organization of the ANSYS program are covered. The basic steps in creating and analyzing a model with ANSYS is discussed in detail. Chapter 9 includes the analysis of two-dimensional heat transfer problems with a section devoted to unsteady situations. Chapter 10 provides analysis of torsion of noncircular shafts and plane stress problems. Dynamic problems are explored in Chapter 11. Review of dynamics and vibrations of mechanical and structural systems are also given in this chapter. In Chapter 12, two-dimensional, ideal fluid-mechanics problems are analyzed. Direct formulation of the piping network problems and underground seepage flow are also discussed. Chapter 13 provides a discussion of three-dimensional elements and formulations. This chapter also presents basic ideas regarding top-down and bottom-up solid modeling methods. The last two chapters of the book are devoted to design and optimization ideas. Design process and material selection are explained in Chapter 14. Design optimization ideas and parametric programming are discussed in Chapter 15. Each chapter begins by stating the objectives and concludes by summarizing what the reader should have gained from studying that chapter. </p> <p> The examples that are solved using ANSYS show in great detail how to use ANSYS to model and analyze a variety of engineering problems. Chapter 8 is also written such that it can be taught right away if the instructor sees the need to start with ANSYS. </p> <p> A brief review of appropriate fundamental principles in solid mechanics, heat transfer, dynamics, and fluid mechanics is also provided throughout the book. Additionally, when appropriate; students are warned about becoming too quick to generate finite element models for problems for which there exist simple analytical solutions. Mechanical and thermophysical properties of some common materials used in engineering are given in appendices A and B. Appendices C and D give properties of common area shapes and properties of structural steel shapes, respectively. Examples of ANSYS batch files are given in Appendix F. </p> <p> Finally, a Web site at <b>http://www.prenhall.com/Moaveni</b> will be maintained for the following purposes: (1) to share any changes in the upcoming versions of ANSYS; (2) to share additional information on upcoming text revisions; (3) to provide additional homework problems and design problems; and (4) although I have done my best to eliminate errors and mistakes, as is with most books, same errors may still exist. I will post the corrections that are brought to my attention at the site. The Web site will be accessible to all instructors and students. </p> <p> SAEED MOAVENI </p></p><h2>Stop Self-Sabotage: Get Out of Your Own Way to Earn More Money, Improve Your Relationships, and Find the Success You Deserve</h2><p><b>Five proven strategies for getting &#x201c;unstuck&#x201d; at work, in relationships, and in life</b> <p>A self-published success, with more than 55,000 copies sold, this practical guide from a licensed psychotherapist shows you how to conquer any negative beliefs that might be sabotaging your life.

He is the author of <i>Georges Bataille and the Mysticism of Sin</i> (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000).<br><br><b>From Peter Connor's Introduction to <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i></b> <p>There is some truth to the argument that <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i> succeeded because it permitted a demoralized population to believe once again in the ideals of valor, courage, and sacrifice that recent experience had so severely challenged. At the same time, there is something inherently unsatisfying about such a line of reasoning. It seems a peculiarly negative way of assessing the worth and impact of a work of art, interesting enough from an extratextual perspective, but neglectful of the intrinsic merits of the play, which might also help explain the thralldom of spectators at the turn of the century and beyond. For a great deal of the aesthetic appeal of this play stems from within: from the ingenuity of its characterization (I refer to Cyrano, obviously, but also to Ragueneau, Cyrano's alter ego, in a sense), from the drama as well as the sheer unexpectedness of its plot (no one was expecting a play about a man with a big nose), from its thrilling dynamism (Rostand is superb at handling large-scale crowd scenes with lots of action; see the opening act). Moreover, in broad terms, <i>Cyrano</i> succeeds because it stages so well the tension between the earthy and the ethereal, between the base and the sublime, and because theatergoers recognize in it an intelligent balance of irony, realism, and fantasy. To go a step further, <i>Cyrano</i> stages the triumph of the ethereal over the earthly, of the sublime over the base. To put this in the language of the play, <i>Cyrano</i> is a staging of panache, without doubt the single most important word in the play and one we will examine here in some detail. </p><p>But first things first. As the title of the play suggests, <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i> is very much about Cyrano, and Cyrano is a likable character. There is hardly a juicier role in the dramatic repertory: Cyrano is almost always on stage, and it is almost always Cyrano who does the talking (to such an extent that even when Christian is speaking, it is often in a sense still Cyrano). Rostand fully exploits the dramatic potential of a character whose physical and verbal assuredness "dominates the situation," to use a phrase Rostand applied to panache. If Cyrano's centrality to the play corresponds to Rostand's dramatic vision, it stems partly also from the circumstances of composition of the play. The part of Cyrano was written for one of the leading actors of the time, Constant Coquelin, whom Rostand had met through Sarah Bernhardt. Rostand got into the habit of showing Coquelin completed sections of the play as he went along. Some of the speeches scripted for other characters so pleased the star of the Paris stage that he claimed them for himself. The famous scene (act two, scene vii) in which Cyrano presents the cadets of Gascony, for example, was originally scripted for Carbon de Castel-Jaloux. (During rehearsals, when the actor playing Le Bret complained that he had very few lines, Coquelin responded: "But you have a fine role. I talk to you all the time.") </p><p>Theater that stages a hero allows for a more immediate and arguably more gratifying forms of identification than the theater of ideas. Like the cadets in the Carbon de Castel-Jaloux's company, the spectators of this play watch and listen to see what Cyrano will do and say next. Now everything Cyrano does and says is governed by what we could call an ethics of panache. Panache is Rostand's word, or at least a word he made his own; before him, no one had used it in quite the same sense. In its simplest and literal sense, panache refers to the feathered plume of a helmet or other type of military headgear. This is the meaning of the word as it appears in act four, scene iv, where Cyrano speaks of Henri IV, who urged his soldiers during the battle of Ivry to "rally around my white plume; you will always find it on the path of honor and glory" (cited in the Bair translation of <i>Cyrano</i>; see "For Further Reading"). But when Cyrano uses the word again at the end of the play-poignantly, it is his and the play's last word-it has acquired a metaphorical dimension, and suggests at once a commitment to valor, a certain elegance, self-esteem verging on pride, and also a certain . . . <i>je ne sais quoi</i>. Such vagueness is disappointing but also inevitable: Rostand himself warned against limiting the meaning of the word to a dictionary definition, as though to do so would be to imprison a sentiment the essence of which is to insist on absolute freedom from convention. </p><p>In his speech to the Acad�mie fran�aise in 1903, Rostand described panache, rather mystically, as "nothing more than a grace." "It is not greatness," he said, "but something added on to greatness, and which moves above it." Panache is not just physical courage in the face of danger; it includes a verbal assertiveness in the face of possible death. "To joke in the face of danger is the supreme form of politeness," Rostand said. Hence panache is "the wit of bravura"&#x2014;not bravura alone (which might be perfectly stupid), but the expression in language of that bravura and indeed language <i>as</i> an expression of bravura: "It is courage that so dominates a particular situation, that it finds just what to say."</p></p><h2>The Action Research Dissertation: A Guide for Students and Faculty</h2><p><p><strong>The Action Research Dissertation: A Guide for Students and Faculty</strong> provides an accessible&nbsp;roadmap that honors the complexity of action research.

McCarthyism was on the run, and movements on the political left were grabbing headlines. The media lampooned John Birchers's accusations that Dwight Eisenhower was a communist puppet. Mainstream America snickered at warnings by California Congressman James B. Utt that "barefooted Africans" were training in Georgia to help the United Nations take over the country. Yet, in Utt's home district of Orange County, thousands of middle-class suburbanites proceeded to organize a powerful conservative movement that would land Ronald Reagan in the White House and redefine the spectrum of acceptable politics into the next century.</p><br><p> <i>Suburban Warriors</i> introduces us to these people: women hosting coffee klatches for Barry Goldwater in their tract houses; members of anticommunist reading groups organizing against sex education; pro-life Democrats gradually drawn into conservative circles; and new arrivals finding work in defense companies and a sense of community in Orange County's mushrooming evangelical churches. We learn what motivated them and how they interpreted their political activity. Lisa McGirr shows that their movement was not one of marginal people suffering from status anxiety, but rather one formed by successful entrepreneurial types with modern lifestyles and bright futures. She describes how these suburban pioneers created new political and social philosophies anchored in a fusion of Christian fundamentalism, xenophobic nationalism, and western libertarianism.</p><br><p> While introducing these rank-and-file activists, McGirr chronicles Orange County's rise from "nut country" to political vanguard. Through this history, she traces the evolution of the New Right from a virulent anticommunist, anti-establishment fringe to a broad national movement nourished by evangelical Protestantism. Her original contribution to the social history of politics broadens&#x2015;and often upsets&#x2015;our understanding of the deep and tenacious roots of popular conservatism in America.</p></p><p><p>"A landmark study that will enlighten anyone who cares about the evolution of American politics since World War II.

This simple and straightforward book explains the basic math used in construction, manufacturing, and design. Starting with fractions and decimals and moving to mitered turns and arcs, these principles are presented with detailed illustrations, practical applications, and in larger print for easy reading. The result is increased efficiency, productivity, and confidence in one&#39;s work from initial design to final product.</p><p>The fact is, you cannot build a house, work on plumbing or electrical systems, repair or remodel, or do anything of much use for your home without a rudimentary understanding of basic mathematics. The Hamiltons have approached math not as a theoretical or abstract academic exercise, but have instead created a system of understanding and remembering mathematical concepts with highly practical applications for the builder, both professional and amateur do-it-yourselfer. They have eliminated confusing and intimidating terminology in favor of clear, straightforward language, guiding the reader through easy-to-understand steps and exercises that virtually guarantee retention of the information in usable form for practical applications. This book should be a standard textbook or required reading for anyone in the building trades--contractors, carpenters, plumbers, electricians, and all the rest--and will likely turn into a classic text for any vocational school or class. <i>--Mark A.

The book coincides with the HOT TO COLD show at the National Building Museum in Washington DC and presents 60 case studies in harsh climate conditions in order to examine where and how we live on our planet.</p><p>As we travel from one end of the spectrum to its opposite we will see that the more harsh the climate gets, the more intense its impact on the architecture. The central challenge is to mitigate the climatic extremes for hospitable human life, while finding solutions that can be both economically and environmentally profitable.</p><p>Architecture is the art and science of accommodating the lives we want to live. Our cities and buildings aren't givens; they are the way they are because that is as far as we have gotten to date. They are the best efforts of our ancestors and fellow planetizens, and if they have shortcomings, it is up to us to continue that effort, pick up where they left off. HOT TO COLD stays true to BIG &#x2013; Bjarke Ingels Group's grand mission to find a pragmatic utopia, shaping not only a particular structural entity, but the kind of world we wish to inhabit.</p><p>The book features:&nbsp;Design from award-winning artists Sagmeister &amp; Walsh</p><p>Previously unpublished essays by Bjarke Ingels.</p><p>A convertible dust jacket-poster.</p></p><p>&#x201c;...This excellent new volume, shows Bjarke Ingels&#x2019; solutions for extreme environments... Marked by a devotion to engaging with cultural and geographic differences, this volume is ideal for those with a sincere commitment to diversity, design and the power of place.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;...a spectacular visual study of the possibilities of region-specific architecture...&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;...it is a beautifully designed book illustrating a diverse range of BIG&#x2019;s international projects and reinforcing BIG as one of the giants in contemporary architecture. This book succeeds as a great reference for architects with material on strategies for climatic design, project clarity and communication tools while also as a small coffee table book that will easily engage and captivate non-architects with its fantastical design.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Norton Book of Science Fiction</h2><p><p><strong>In the tradition of other groundbreaking Norton Collections, Ursula K.

Such readily accessible data have encouraged the proliferation of adaptive arguments for the evolution of gene and genomic features, often with little or no attention being given to simpler and more powerful alternative explanations. By integrating the central observations from molecular biology and population genetics relevant to comparative genomics, Lynch shows why the details matter.<br><br>Presented in a nontechnical fashion, at both the population-genetic and molecular-genetic levels, this book offers a unifying explanatory framework for how the peculiar architectural diversity of eukaryotic genomes and genes came to arise. Under Lynch's hypothesis, the genome-wide repatterning of eukaryotic gene structure, which resulted primarily from nonadaptive processes, provided an entirely novel resource from which natural selection could secondarily build new forms of organismal complexity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Lynch</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Biology at Indiana University. He received his B.S. in Biology from St. Bonaventure University, and his Ph.D. in Ecology from the University of Minnesota. Dr. Lynch has served as President of both the Society for the Study of Evolution and the American Genetic Association, and is a past council member of the Society for Molecular Biology and Evolution, and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His research is focused on mechanisms of evolution at the gene, genomic, cellular, and phenotypic levels, with special attention being given to the roles of mutation, random genetic drift, and recombination.<br><br>"This book is a must-read for every genome researcher. It is the most up-to-date and thorough summary of genome evolution published. Almost every page introduces interesting, unanswered problems, making it a gold mine for graduate students in search of a thesis topic." <br>--Axel Meyer, <em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"If you want a good summary of what genomics has revealed about genome architecture over the last two decades, merged with a nontechnical exposition of the relevant principles of population genetics, this is the book to get." <br>--Daniel Hartl, <em>Nature Genetics</em><p></p><br>"The book's first twelve chapters are a must-read for anyone interested in the evolution of genomes. As a whole, <em>Origins of Genome Architecture</em> represents a serious, valiant, and highly scholarly attempt at making sense of the new data provided by the genomic revolution. To that aim, Lynch deploys the full array of conceptual tools that make up the modern synthesis paradigm in evolutionary biology." <br>--Massimo Pigliucci, <em>Science</em><p></p><br>"This volume would be an excellent foundation for an upper-level undergraduate course or a graduate seminar. It has become increasingly clear that a blind reliance on the explanatory power of natural selection has led to a lot of "sloppy thinking" and this book is a start toward clearing up some of this problem." <br>--Richard J. Mural, <em>The Quarterly Review of Biology</em><p></p><br>"This is a truly remarkable book, which will forever change your view of evolutionary biology. Anyone with even tangential interest in evolution needs to read the preface, epilogue, and especially the fourth chapter on population size. Lynch takes a detailed knowledge of molecular genetics and genomics, combined with a refined fluency in population genetics, to create sound sweeping descriptions and predictions about evolution. Read Lynch's book, have your students read it, and let's revise our views of evolution." <br>--Root Gorelick, <em>Plant Science Bulletin</em><p></p><br>"Lynch presents a synthesis of molecular genetics and evolutionary biology with a goal of driving new interdisciplinary research and understanding. He succeeds admirably. This extremely interesting book presents genomic evolution in a comprehensive manner and with different perspectives. What makes this volume so useful is that each chapter presents not only what and how, but also why (and why it matters). This book will appeal to everyone interested in genetics, molecular biology, and evolution. It is highly recommended." <br>--D.

R. Leavis, Stefan Collini has carefully and skillfully disentangled the many strands. The tale he tells is instructive in many respects - and perhaps more important now than it was when Leavis gave his response, fifty years ago." <br>Alan Jacobs, Books and Culture</p><h2>Paul the Convert: The Apostolate and Apostasy of Saul the Pharisee</h2><p>Although Paul&#x2019;s writings have been intensively studied by Christian theologians, they have been dismissed by Jewish scholars as the meditations of an antagonistic apostate who broke completely with his Jewish past. In this revisionist account of Paul&#x2019;s work, Alan Segal argues that Paul&#x2019;s life can be better understood by taking his Jewishness seriously, and that Jewish history can be illuminated greatly by examining Paul&#x2019;s writings. By reading Paul from the viewpoint of the religion he left behind, Segal sheds new light on the man who played a critical role in both Judaism and Christianity. &nbsp;"Segal&#x2019;s new book challenges Jewish and Christian scholars alike to take a fresh look at this well-educated man."&#x2015;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i><br><br>"Segal has written a blockbuster of a book about Paul that blazes a new trail. It not only gives new insights into Paul and his thought, but it establishes the writings of Paul as significant primary source material for the study of first-century Judaism.."&#x2015;Hayim Goren Perelmuter, <i>New Theology Review</i><br><br>"A brilliantly argued book. . . . Paul is neither hero nor villain for Segal but a fascinating historical and religious character, from whom we can learn much about both Judaism and Christianity. . . . I found myself thoroughly sympathetic to Segal&#x2019;s portrayal of Paul. More than that, I found myself convinced."&#x2015;J. Christian Wilson, <i>The Christian Century</i><br><br>"<i>Paul the Convert</i> is<i> </i>a stunning achievement. Segal brilliantly weaves together Jewish studies, New Testament scholarship, and contemporary social scientific theories of conversion into a richly textured and provocative book."&#x2015;Lewis R. Rambo, Professor of Psychology and Religion, San Francisco Theological Seminary&nbsp;"This is by far the best book about Paul I have ever read: it revolutionizes Pauline studies. . . . Segal has made Paul, and early Christianity, more understandable and therefore deserves the heartfelt thanks of all believers and unbelievers."&#x2015;Giles Quispel, <i>Vigiliae Christianae</i></p><p>Segal's Saul of Tarsus is a man consumed with uniting Jews and gentiles in a community focused on the resurrected Messiah. Although his efforts largely failed, Paul left behind several thriving gentile congregations and a wealth of primary source material for the study of first-century Judaism. Segal combines New Testament scholarship, modern psychological studies of conversion, and a thorough knowledge of the rabbinic literature to provide the reader with some remarkable insights into Paul's life and writings. Segal's dispassionate treatment of Paul is much preferred to the polemical speculation of Hyam Maccoby's The Mythmaker ( LJ 6/15/86).

Because its knowledge of the world is systematically distorted by the elite domination which has shaped it, the master rationality has developed &#39;blind spots&#39; which may threaten our survival. The future depends increasingly on our ability to create a truly democratic and ecological culture beyond dualism.<strong>'This book is path-breaking systematically extending the feminist critique of international locking dualisms in Western philosophy to argue that the domination of nature flows from them as much as the domination of race, gender and class.'</strong> - <em>Environmental Politics</em><br><br><strong>'Puncturing the myth of 'the angel in the ecosystem', Plumwood aims to develop a genuinely critical ecological feminism.

Davidson thoroughly explores Sagan's science, wrestles with his politics, and plumbs his personal passions with a telling instinct for the revealing underside of a life lived so publicly."-Los Angeles Times<br><br>Carl Sagan was one of the most celebrated scientists of this century-the handsome and alluring visionary who inspired a generation to look to the heavens and beyond. His life was both an intellectual feast and an emotional rollercoaster. Based on interviews with Sagan's family and friends, including his widow, Ann Druyan; his first wife, acclaimed scientist Lynn Margulis; and his three sons, as well as exclusive access to many personal papers, this highly acclaimed life story offers remarkable insight into one of the most influential, provocative, and beloved figures of our time-a complex, contradictory prophet of the Space Age.</p><p>Carl Sagan may have been one of the greatest scientists who ever lived. Then again, he may have been a relentless self-promoter who convinced everyone he was one of the greatest scientists who ever lived. Keay Davidson, science writer for the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>, aims to explain this complicated man in his biography. One thing is clear: Sagan was an extremely difficult man to love, a scientist whose passion for astronomy and biology was unparalleled, but who had little ability to express basic emotions to his wives and children. Davidson looks for reasons for this emotional distance in Sagan's childhood, when his relationship with his mother was intense and sometimes difficult. She encouraged her bright young son to be an "intellectual omnivore," to be passionate about knowledge, but she didn't give him the tools to relate to humans as individuals.<p> As his stellar science career developed, Sagan built a reputation as a leftist who believed that "science could serve liberal ideals," and as an arrogant man with an unshakable confidence in his own brain. Davidson writes that Sagan developed his famous skepticism as an undergraduate. Sagan suffered from a "troubling mix of intense emotion and stark rationalism," writes Davidson. He succeeded (mostly) in balancing passion with reason, a balance that made him a perfect popularizer of science, a trustworthy authority who preached that an open mind was the most valuable scientific tool. Davidson was influenced personally by Sagan's writings, and he sometimes works a little too hard at puncturing the myths surrounding Sagan, but this biography is one that deserves to be read by Sagan's fans and detractors alike. It's a compelling, very <i>real</i> assessment of an all-too-human god of science. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p>Carl Sagan was one of the most celebratedscientists of his time-the leading visionary of the Space Age. He was also a highly controversial figure who inspired wildly opposed opinions. His enthusiasm and eloquence about the wonders of space, the marvels of the human brain, and the mysteries of life captured the imagination of millions. Yet one scientist was so enraged by Sagan's scientific pronouncements that he compared him to the Black Plague, and William F. Buckley Jr. likened him to circus huckster P. T. Barnum.<br><br>Sagan's life was both an intellectual feast and an emotional roller coaster. Whether he was searching for life on Mars or visiting Timothy Leary in prison, prophesying exciting scientific discoveries or getting arrested for protesting nuclear weapons, debating the existence of UFOs or advocating the creative benefits of smoking marijuana, Carl Sagan was a fascinating, charismatic, and complex man full of contradictions.<br><br>A passionate debunker of pseudoscience, Sagan was nevertheless so enthralled by the prospects of discovering life out in space that he championed science-fiction-like ideas about communication with alien superbeings, spaceflight to the stars, and "balloon animals" floating in the skies of Jupiter. A man with a dazzling social life, who hobnobbed with everyone from Nobel laureates to the Dalai Lama, and celebrities like Johnny Carson, Jodie Foster, and Paul Newman, he was also intensely private, and even many of his closest friends felt they knew little about the real man inside.<br><br>The son of Jewish immigrants living in middle-class Brooklyn-a father who had fled Czarist Russia and a vivacious but acid-tongued mother-he became a staunch religious skeptic. Though he was doted on by his domineering mother and had a close relationship with his father, he largely neglected his first two sons, and while he avidly espoused feminist views, his sexism ruined his first marriage. An illicit affair tore apart his second. Yet in his third marriage, he found lasting love, and he learned to be a more engaged and giving father.<br><br>Certainly, Sagan was a magnificent writer and TV showman-"the greatest popularizer of the twentieth century," Science magazine called him after his untimely death at age 62 from a rare precancerous blood disease. He made science "sexy" again to a generation repelled by nuclear weapons and other scientific horrors. His TV series Cosmos awed hundreds of millions around the world, and his bestseller The Dragons of Eden won the Pulitzer Prize. Yet the value of his scientific work was often called into question. His Ph.D. dissertation narrowly escaped rejection, he was denied tenure at Harvard, and in thetwilight of his life, he was denied membership in the prestigious National Academy of Sciences.<br><br>In this insightful and evenhanded biography, acclaimed science journalist Keay Davidson reveals for the first time the man behind the famous image-the storm of contradictions and passions that animated this enigmatic and entrancing man who remained, at heart, the five-year-old Brooklyn boy who looked up at the stars and asked: What are they? Davidson draws on an unprecedented wealth of interviews with Sagan's family members, friends, colleagues, admirers, and detractors, as well as from a vast archive of unpublished writings and intimate personal papers. The result is one of the most thought-provoking scientific biographies of our time-a probing and critical yet affectionate portrait of the man who, more than any other, epitomized the boldest dreams of the Space Age.</p><h2>Alberto Giacometti: Drawings and Watercolours. The Bruno Giacometti Bequest</h2><p>Swiss artist Alberto Giacometti (1901&#x2013;66) was one of the leading surrealist sculptors and inarguably one of the greatest artists of the twentieth century. His sculptures and drawings&#x2015;displaying emaciated figures isolated in space&#x2015;offer a revealing look into issues of mortality, embodiment, and the human condition, while giving physical expression to Giacometti&#x2019;s twin obsessions, the human form and the alienation of modern life. In this book, Monique Meyer presents previously unpublished drawings and watercolors by the prolific artist from the collection Giacometti&#x2019;s youngest brother Bruno bequeathed to Kunsthaus Z�rich.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Comprising about one hundred of Giacometti&#x2019;s works on paper, this well-guarded family treasure represents the artist&#x2019;s entire life, from his youth in Stampa, Switzerland to his later years in Paris. This collection includes very early copies of works by old masters as well as studies of ancient Egyptian and Roman sculptures from the 1920s. It also shows how closely Giacometti looked at the art of Henri Matisse, Paul C�zanne, and Auguste Rodin, which then led to highly individual interpretations of their work. In addition, it contains important drawings of some of Giacometti&#x2019;s relatives along with self-portraits, alpine landscapes from his native Val Bregaglia, and masterful figure studies from the 1950s and 60s.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br> Featuring 144 color images, this concise book features the first selection of these works the world has seen alongside an essay on their history and significance and an illustrated catalogue of the entire collection.</p><p><b>Monique Meyer</b> is a research assistant at Kunsthaus Z�rich&#x2019;s collection of prints and drawings.</p><h2>Occupational and Environmental Health: Recognizing and Preventing Disease and Injury</h2><p>Occupational and environmental health is the public health and multidisciplinary approach to the recognition, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control of disease, injuries, and other adverse health conditions resulting from hazardous environmental exposures in the workplace, the home, or the community.

Set against this sweeping, 170-year rise of the Clare Soap and Chemical Company is the contemporary story of Laura Bodey, a real-estate broker. Laura, her two teenage children, and her ex-husband all live in Lacewood, Illinois, a place that owes its very existence to the regional Clare factories that have nursed the town from nothing. The Clare Agricultural Division now sponsors every aspect of Lacewood, from the corn boil to the college library. But when a cyst on Laura&#39;s ovary turns malignant and the local industry is implicated, the insignificant individual and the corporate behemoth collide, forever changing the shape of American life.</p><p>Richard Powers made his debut in 1985 with <i>Three Farmers on Their Way to a Dance</i>, a brilliant and almost unbelievably brainy meditation on what he calls "our tortured century." Since then he has produced four more novels, showcasing his mastery of genetics, art history, computer science, theology, aesthetics, and a host of other pointy-headed fields. The author's range--and the meticulous music of his prose, which suggests a considerably less zany Thomas Pynchon--is mind-boggling. Yet his subject remains fairly constant: the acceleration, and consequent dehumanization, of contemporary life.<p> In <i>Gain</i>, Powers puts our modernity through the wringer once again. This time, though, he points the finger at one villain in particular: rampant, American-style capitalism, as exemplified by a conglomerate called Clare International. His novel, it should be said, is no piece of agitprop, but an intricate lamination of two separate stories. On one hand, Powers describes the rise (and fall and rise) of the Clare empire, beginning in its mercantile infancy: "That family flocked to commerce like finches to morning. They clung to the watery edge of existence: ports, always ports. They thrived in tidal pools, half salt, half sweet." The author's Clare-eyed narrative amounts to a pocket history of corporate America, and a marvelously entertaining one. Lest we get too enamored of this success story, though, Powers introduces a second, countervailing tale, in which a 42-year-old resident of Lacewood, Illinois, is stricken with ovarian cancer. Lacewood happens to be the headquarters of Clare's North American Agricultural Products Division, and lo and behold, it seems that chemical wastes from the plant may be the source of Laura Bodey's illness. The analogy between corporate and cancerous proliferation is pointed--too pointed, perhaps. But no other recent novelist has written so knowingly, and with such splendid indignation, about capitalism <i>and</i> its discontents.</p>"Erudite, penetrating and splendidly written...There is no gainsaying the remarkable artistry and authority with which Powers, in this dazzling book, continues to impart his singular vision of our life and times." --Bruce Bawer, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> "Powers is a writer of blistering intellect; he has only to think about a subject and the paint curls off. He is a novelist of ideas and a novelist of witness, and in both respects he has few American peers." --Richard Eder, <i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i></p><p> "Richard Powers' powerful and peculiar novel, <i>Gain</i>, is the largest compliment any author has paid to the American reading public in decades." --Thomas M. Disch, <i>Washington Post Book World</i></p><p> "<i>Gain</i> consists equally of horizon-busting breadth of knowledge and excruciating depth of vulnerability...Powers hovers impossibly between extremes with a tightrope walker's perfect balance. He may be at once the smartest and the most warm-hearted novelist in America today." --Melvin Jules Bukiet, <i>The Chicago Tribune</i></p><p> "Richard Powers has proven himself a visionary writer...Throughout <i>Gain</i> there are dreamy, uncannily accurate little paragraphs on the Promethean messianism of corporate America." --Greil Marcus, <i>The San Francisco Examiner &amp; Chronicle</i></p><p> "Subtle, provocative, and powerful...Richard Powers' deceptively simple and terrifyingly effective novel <i>Gain</i> says it better than anyone has in a long time: buyer beware." --Rick Moody, <i>Voice Literary Supplement</i></p></p><h2>Eliot Porter: In the Realm of Nature</h2><p>Known for his exquisite images of birds and landscape, Eliot Porter (American, 1901&#x2013;1990) was a pioneer in the use of color photography. His work also became a powerful visual argument for environmental conservation. Trained as a medical doctor and possessing a scientist's gift for close observation, Porter explored new ways of depicting nature, building blinds in trees so he could study his avian subjects at closer vantage, and producing landscape images that capture both pristine forest and ragged river canyons with equal force and brilliance.&nbsp;Initially encouraged by the&nbsp;groundbreaking photographers Ansel Adams and Alfred Stieglitz, Porter went on to produce a body of work all his own. His 1962 Sierra Club book <i>In Wildness Is the Preservation of the World,</i> with its images grouped by season and accompanied by quotations from Henry David Thoreau, transformed the concept of nature photography books. Ultimately, Porter's photographs came to the attention of Congress and led to the passage of the Wilderness Act of 1964, the foundational law in wilderness management today.<i>Eliot Porter: In the Realm of Nature</i> contains 110 images from the collections of Daniel Greenberg and Susan Steinhauser; the Amon Carter Museum, Fort Worth, Texas; and of the J. Paul Getty Museum, along with an essay by Paul Martineau that discusses Porter's life and the innovations he brought to the practice of photography.</p><p>My interest in Eliot Porter began in 2003 when I came across a portfolio containing his vibrantly colored photographs of grass marshes, lichen-covered trees, and leaf-strewn ponds. I had recently relocated from Massachusetts to Los Angeles to take a job in the Department of Photographs at the J. Paul Getty Museum, and Porter&#39;s photographs of the New England woods reminded me of the places I had explored as a child. Recognizing the power of these photographs to transport me to another place, I proposed an exhibition of the work for the summer of 2006. The selection of plates in this book is loosely based on that exhibition and expanded to include some of Porter&#39;s best photographs of the American Southwest.Paul Martineau is an associate curator in the Department of Photographs at the J. Paul Getty Museum and author of<i> Herb Ritts: L.A. Style </i>(Getty, 2012) and <i>Paul Outerbridge: Command Performance </i>(Getty, 2009).

Its grim reality, captured through the new medium of photography, was laid bare. American artists could not approach the conflict with the conventions of European history painting, which glamorized the hero on the battlefield. Instead, many artists found ways to weave the war into works of art that considered the human narrative&#x2014;the daily experiences of soldiers, slaves, and families left behind. Artists and writers wrestled with the ambiguity and anxiety of the Civil War and used landscape imagery to give voice to their misgivings as well as their hopes for themselves and the nation.</p><p>This important book looks at the range of artwork created before, during, and following the war, in the years between 1852 and 1877. Author Eleanor Jones Harvey surveys paintings made by some of America's finest artists, including Frederic Church, Sanford Gifford, Winslow Homer, and Eastman Johnson, and photographs taken by George Barnard, Alexander Gardner, and Timothy H. O'Sullivan.&nbsp;<br><br> Harvey examines American&nbsp;landscape and genre painting and the new medium of photography to understand both how artists made sense of the war and how they portrayed what was a deeply painful, complex period in American history. Enriched by firsthand accounts of the war by soldiers, former slaves, abolitionists, and statesmen, Harvey's research demonstrates how these artists used painting and photography to reshape American culture. Alongside the artworks, period voices (notably those of&nbsp;Emily Dickinson, Mark Twain, and Walt Whitman) amplify the anxiety and dilemmas of wartime America.&nbsp;</p></p><p>&#x201c;In landscape paintings during the Civil War years, the skies and geography told a version of the story, bringing together literary metaphor and visual imagery to create a war-inflected layer of meaning. When we consider the literature, speeches, sermons, and letters that invoked stormy weather, volcanic eruptions, and celestial portents to understand the war and all its profound consequences, that imagery gains depth and the paintings&#x2019; meaning becomes clearer.

Davidson, who places the novel in a historical and literary perspective. Written in 1822, A New-England Tale is the first of the many novels, tales, and short magazine pieces Catharine Sedgwick published during her lifetime. The story of an orphan girl in rural New England and the moral trials she faces as she grows up, this early example of the popular nineteenth-century women&#39;s novel provides a unique look at the religious and social climate at this crucial period in America&#39;s national development. Addressing many of the complex religious, political, and philosophical issues of the time, as well as concerns of the woman writer, A New-England Tale is a classic story of a young woman&#39;s moral and material triumphs.</p><p><br><strong>Cathy N.

Combining the appeal of Disney cartoons with the sophisticated &#34;primitivism&#34; of such artists as Jean Dubuffet, these underground artworks were bold, humorous, accessible, subversive - and the work of one man - Keith Haring. Over the next decade, Haring went on to create a body of work that would capture the energy and excitement of New York&#39;s brash street culture - and transmute punk, new wave, hip-hop, graffiti and break dancing into an instantly recognizable pop iconography. He frequently bypassed the gallery scene, preferring to address people directly through drawings and paintings in public spaces and with mass-produced items based on his designs.

Full of mischief, insight, and pathos, Kesey's powerful story of a mental ward and its inhabitants probes the meaning of madness, often turning conventional notions of sanity and insanity on their heads.<p>The tale is chronicled by the seemingly mute Indian patient, Chief Bromden; its hero is Randle Patrick McMurphy, the boisterous, brawling, fun-loving rebel who encourages gambling, drinking, and sex in the ward, and rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorial rule of Big Nurse. McMurphy's defiance -- which begins as a sport -- develops into a grim struggle with the awesome power of the "Combine", concluding with shattering, tragic results. In its unforgettable portrait of a man teaching the value of self-reliance and laughter destroyed by forces of hatred and fear, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is a classic parable that has left an indelible mark on the literature of our time.</p><b>Ken Kesey</b> (1935&#x2013;2001) graduated from the University of Oregon and later studied at Stanford with Wallace Stegner, Malcolm Cowley, Richard Scowcroft, and Frank O&#x2019;Connor. <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x2019;s Nest</i>, his first novel, was published in 1962.

For children with ASDs, very little in the world around them is the way it ought to be. Taking time to gain an appreciation for the way your child, client, or student sees the world is invaluable in understanding their often puzzling behavior and more rationally developing educational, medical, and other intervention plans. Some days it may seem that children with ASDs wake up in the morning wondering what they can do to drive their parents and teachers crazy. In reality, children with ASDs are doing their best to make their world understandable, predictable, and tolerable&#x2014;the way it <i>ought</i> to be (at least from their perspective). Our job is to figure out how to make their world more manageable by understanding why they are doing what they're doing and teaching them more effective ways of overcoming the problems they encounter. The world is very confusing and at times scary for children and youth with ASDs. They don't understand what people say to them and the meaning behind people's actions. They don't understand what will occur, in which order it will occur, or when it will occur. The most fundamental problem each person with autism faces is how to gain control over a disorderly world. They need their environment to be predicable. When a child with an ASD screams, cries, has tantrums, or slaps his or her own face, it is often intended to make his or her parents stop making demands. Children with autism don't understand what is being said to them and they fear that it involves some change they are unable to tolerate. If a daily routine is changed, their aggression is intended to make their parents restore it the way it <i>ought</i> to be&#x2014;from their perspective.</p><p>Many parents and teachers feel that they are losing control of the situation if they are unable to insist that the child with an ASD obey them&#x2014;usually immediately. Ordering the child to do things, or not do things, and expecting prompt compliance will inevitably result in frustration for everyone involved and, very likely, a fracas. Each successive altercation over "who's in control here" will make matters worse.</p><p>One of the more effective ways to gain control over the behavior of a child with an ASD is often to relinquish some control over things that matter greatly to the child and are relatively unimportant to you. By teaching a child legitimate ways of controlling his or her world, even if some of the things that seem important to them don't make much sense to you, the child will feel more secure. He or she will no longer need to throw a tantrum, hit or bite, or otherwise harm him&#x2013; or herself to make the world change. By providing the child with ways of gaining some control over the timing of when things are done and some details of how they are done, and giving them appropriate ways to communicate their need to leave disturbing situations, parents, teachers, therapists, and other caregivers, you will gain the child's trust and in the long run have a more loving and effective relationship with the child.</p><p><b>Searching for Help</b></p><p>When I first met Ross and Beth nearly 40 years ago, very little was known about autism. They wondered what was wrong with Matt. Beth spent hours poring over her pregnancy with Matt, almost day by day, to see if she had taken medicine she shouldn't have or was exposed to an unknown toxin that might have caused Matt's condition. Matt's pediatrician referred Matt's parents to a child psychiatrist, who expressed special interest in his parents' sex life and asked probing questions about whether Matt had been planned or was the result of an unwanted pregnancy. They were angry and humiliated by his questions but most of all felt a growing sense of hopelessness. Matt was taken to a pediatric neurologist who said that Matt had mental retardation and there wasn't much that could be done for him. A university clinical psychologist was the first to mention autism to Matt's parents. The psychologist said there wasn't very much known about autism at that time, but that perhaps I could help them. That was shortly after Ross and Beth had reluctantly placed Matt in a state&#x2013;operated institution for people with mental retardation. Matt lived in a newer building for children and adolescents called a Learning Center. At the time, Ross made a promise to himself and Beth: "We'll do whatever is necessary to bring Matt home from that place."</p><p>Matt's parents and I visited him in his residence, a one&#x2013;story building on the outskirts of a small town, 21/2 hours north of his home&#x2014;an encounter that was terribly difficult for Matt's parents. Matt, who was 6 years old, had scratches and bruises on his hands and arms and a large bruise on his knee, the result, the staff said, of falling during an attempt to climb on top of furniture. Matt approached his parents without looking directly at them, flicking his fingers in front of his eyes, and moving his head strangely from side to side. He made no attempt to talk with them nor did he attempt to take their hands or otherwise interact with them. His mother put her arm around him, but Matt turned away, seemingly indifferent to his mother's gesture. The staff clearly liked Matt and tried to reassure his parents about how well he was doing. As she wiped tears from her eyes, Beth pleaded, "What can we do, my God, what can we do? There must be something better than this. Is there no way to help Matt?"</p><p>Matt appeared utterly frustrated about something, but what? His activity level was phenomenal. He never stopped moving. He climbed on, under, and over furniture. He picked up toys and puzzle pieces, skillfully twirling them like a juggler, often glancing in another direction as he did so. He appeared to want something, but what? One almost had the impression that he was trying to make sense out of an incomprehensible situation. He picked up puzzle pieces and sniffed them instead of looking at them. Instead of looking directly at objects, he tilted his head to one side and seemed to study them out of the corner of his eye. At other times staff members attempted to encourage Matt to participate in a game or activity, but Matt turned away abruptly with what appeared to be an angry expression on his face. At one point when a staff member was particularly persistent, Matt began slapping his own face, harder and harder until someone restrained him, saying "No, Matt, no hitting." Matt's mother left the room when she heard the first slap.</p><p>Early the following Friday morning, Matt's parents drove the 130 miles to pick him up from the state&#x2013;operated residence and bring him home for the weekend. I met them at their house and noticed that Matt seemed calmer than he had been at the institution but difficult to engage. He showed no reaction when spoken to and walked aimlessly from room to room, stopping to stare out the window. I held out two of his favorite snacks, M&amp;Ms and sugarcoated cereal. He studied them briefly and then snatched some cereal and ran away to consume it. He must have learned that habit in the institution in which food theft by peers was common. He returned within a few minutes and this time looked more carefully at the two snacks, different items in each hand. He selected one and immediately put it in his mouth. I said, "Good job, Matt." He showed no reaction to my comment. When Matt returned, I closed both of my hands concealing the snack items in each. This time he grabbed one hand and turned it over. As I opened my hand, he studied three Cracker Jacks and then grabbed the other hand, prying it open. It contained M&amp;Ms. Matt grabbed the pieces of candy and placed them his mouth and walked away more slowly, making a humming sound. After a few minutes he returned and seemed to be looking for something&#x2014;my hands. I held my hands behind my back. "Want a treat, Matt?" I asked. He tried to pull my hand from behind my back. I placed both hands in front of him, each enclosing a snack. "What do you want, Matt?" He touched my hand and I immediately turned it over revealing two M&amp;Ms. He quickly picked them up, this time very deftly with one finger and his thumb. His fine motor dexterity was impressive. I continued holding out the other hand enclosing another treat. "What do you want, Matt?" I asked. He touched my hand, and I immediately turned it over so he could retrieve several Cracker Jacks. "Good job, Matt," I said. He glanced up at me briefly, expressionless, and walked away.</p><p>We took a short break and I suggested to Matt's mother that she cut out the logo from the front of the cereal box and the M&amp;M logo from the candy container and paste them on two pieces of cardboard. I placed them on the table in front of Matt and held my hands above each card. The left hand containing two M&amp;Ms was above the M&amp;M card, and the right hand containing several pieces of cereal was above the logo of the cereal. "What do you want, Matt?" I asked. He touched my hand containing the cereal and I promptly opened it. He shoved it away seemingly in irritation and immediately grabbed the other hand. He retrieved the M&amp;Ms and ate them. Matt had clear preferences. I pointed to both cards and said, "What do you want, Matt?" He looked puzzled at first and made an odd sound, similar to the rising inflection when asking a question. Then he touched the M&amp;M card and I opened my hand containing the M&amp;M. He was catching on to the idea that a picture could represent something he wanted. Matt understood what I meant when I asked, "What do you want?" and he used a simple gesture of pointing at the picture to say, "I want M&amp;Ms." That was the beginning of Matt's communication.</p><p>Soon, instead of providing edible rewards, we showed Matt pictures of items or activities he might like and asked the same question, "What do you want, Matt?" When he pointed to the picture, he was tickled, given his favorite toy, or his favorite song was turned on so he could hear it, depending on the picture to which he pointed. After several hours practicing making requests by touching a picture of what he wanted, I left, suggesting to Matt's parents that they continue to work on using pictures to communicate with Matt for the rest of the weekend. On Sunday afternoon, Matt was returned to the institution for another week, which to Beth and Ross seemed an eternity.</p><p>I called the following Monday, and Beth reported that early Sunday morning, Matt had had a terrible tantrum and bit his father's hand. Matt had apparently wanted something but there was no picture that represented it. When they were unable to figure out what he wanted, he became increasingly angry&#x2014;screaming, throwing things, and finally biting his father. "I don't know if we can do this, Travis," Matt's mother said. "Ross has a lot of trouble keeping his cool when Matt acts like that, and I can't blame him."</p><p>That Monday evening I had coffee with them at their home and we discussed the incident. "Just when I thought we were making progress, everything fell apart," Ross said. "It must be terribly frustrating," I replied. Actually, Matt was doing much better, despite the tantrum and outburst. It was just that he thought his parents ought to understand what he wanted, now that they were beginning to communicate with him. The problem was that there was no symbol that represented what he wanted. Over the coming weeks, we worked together to teach Matt new skills that were useful at home and improved his communication. By trial and error his parents developed an inventory of activities and items he most often wanted and created picture cards representing each. Later his picture menu included going swimming at the YMCA, going with his mother to the library, playing a game with his sister, and various community activities. Eventually, he used a communication board with pictures of the 8&amp;8211;10 items or activities he most often requested. Matt's frustration was clearly fading, and his interest in his family was increasing.</p><p>At times Matt brought his picture card menu to his mother with a disturbed expression on his face. He waved the card in agitation and made a very unhappy sound, half a cry and half an angry growl. That was our clue that what he wanted wasn't on the picture menu. That was when Matt's parents came up with the idea of asking him to point at what he wanted. He led them to the room in which the item he wanted was located (in the kitchen) and pointed with a sweep of his hand toward cupboards above the refrigerator. His mother climbed on a stool and opened the cabinet doors and Matt very animatedly pointed at the bag of popcorn seeds. Though it was only 9 A.M., his mother popped popcorn for Matt. As they sat together at the kitchen table, Beth rubbed Matt's arm as he wolfed down the popcorn. Matt had begun to smile at his parents, which was one of those special occasions Beth would always remember.</p><p>After 2 months of weekend visits, Matt came home for good. We had used each weekend visit to practice new skills and conduct refreshers on those previously acquired. Ross and Beth were becoming more confident that they could help Matt learn and manage his behavior problems. They had previously lost confidence in their ability to parent Matt. Over the next year Matt continued to make progress, but gains alternated with periods of turmoil and disappointment. Matt liked to help his mother prepare dinner, and she allowed him to stir melting butter into hot peas and pour milk or juice. Matt was fascinated by shining objects or surfaces and twirled his mother's keys and balanced a spoon on its handle and made it spin. His skill at spinning things without them falling over was uncanny. Beth had to watch Matt closely to prevent him from burning himself when she was cooking because he liked to lean over boiling water or a sizzling frying pan and watch the bubbles dance on the surface.</p><p>During one of my visits to their home, Beth asked me if it were true that children with autism don't bond with their mothers, as she had read in an article in a magazine. Before I could answer, Ross interjected, "Watch this," and Beth shouted upstairs, "Matt, it's time for bed." Matt came bounding down the stairs, two steps at a time, and plopped himself down beside his mother on the sofa. She opened a children's book and began reading. With her first words, he leaned his head against her shoulder and she put her arm around him. He flicked a puzzle piece in his hands, but listened attentively at the same time. The words in the book were more complicated than he could fully understand, but the act of reading with the rising and falling intonation of Beth's voice and the vibrations from her body as she read seemed comforting to Matt. It was a remarkably affectionate scene, reminiscent of the comfort a newborn infant receives from hearing his or her mother's heartbeat while being held at her breast.

Based on research in USA, Asia, Latin America, and Europe, it aims to formulate a systematic theory of the information society which takes account of the fundamental effects of information technology on the contemporary world. <p>The global economy is now characterized by the almost instantaneous flow and exchange of information, capital and cultural communication. These flows order and condition both consumption and production. The networks themselves reflect and create distinctive cultures. Both they and the traffic they carry are largely outside national regulation. Our dependence on the new modes of informational flow gives enormous power to those in a position to control them to control us. The main political arena is now the media, and the media are not politically answerable.</p> <p><br> Manuel Castells describes the accelerating pace of innovation and application. He examines the processes of globalization that have marginalized and now threaten to make redundant whole countries and peoples excluded from informational networks. He investigates the culture, institutions and organizations of the network enterprise and the concomitant transformation of work and employment. He shows that in the advanced economies production is now concentrated on an educated section of the population aged between 25 and 40: many economies can do without a third or more of their people. He suggests that the effect of this accelerating trend may not be mass unemployment but the extreme flexibilization of work and individualization of labor, and, in consequence, a highly segmented social structure.</p></p><p><i>The Rise of the Network Society</i>, the first volume in a trilogy collectively known as the Information Age, has earned Manuel Castells comparisons to such illustrious social critics as Max Weber and Karl Marx. Just as they worked to make sense of industrial capitalism, so does Castells put forth a systemic analysis of the global informational capitalism that emerged in the last half of the 20th century. While many books have considered the development of increasingly sophisticated information technology, the shifting conditions of employment and responsibility within corporations, or the rise of corporations whose domains are spread out over several nation-states, Castells unites these topics in a comprehensive thesis, negotiating the tightrope between academic sociology and mainstream business analysis.<b>Manuel Castells</b> is Professor of Sociology and of Planning at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was appointed in 1979, after teaching for 12 years at the University of Paris.

In this new edition of his widely acclaimed Leaving College, Vincent Tinto synthesizes far-ranging research on student attrition and on actions institutions can and should take to reduce it. The key to effective retention, he demonstrates, lies in a strong commitment to quality education and the building of a strong sense of inclusive educational and social community on campus. This completely revised and expanded edition incorporates the explosion of recent research and policy reports on why students leave higher education. Using this new information, Tinto extends his theory of student departure to the experiences of minority, adult, and graduate students, and to the situation facing commuting institutions and two-year colleges. He has revised his theory as well, giving new emphasis to the central importance of the classroom experience and to the role of multiple college communities. Leaving College combines Tinto&#39;s review of recent research with the theoretical work of Emile Durkheim and Arnold van Gennep to develop a theory of departure that explains the complex process of events leading individuals to withdraw from college, a theory that reflects the actions and attitudes of the college community as much as those of the student leaving. Tinto offers principles of attrition that in turn form the basis of his discussion of institutional policy. Ultimately, he argues, the secret of effective retention lies not in the types of programs institutions construct for their students, but in the underlying commitment to students that inspires these programs. Hisargument that institutions must place the goal of retention second to that of student education provides a welcome corrective to institutional policies that look only at the ledger sheet. Up-to-the-minute research data will make this important book even more valuable, not only to those who study education but also to those who make important decisions about students and education policy generally.<b>Vincent Tinto</b> is Distinguished Professor of Education at Syracuse University and coauthor of <i>Where Colleges Are and Who Attends: Effects of Accessibility on College Attendance</i>.</p><h2>Red, White and Black: The Peoples of Early North America</h2><p>A history text of America&#39;s colonial period, emphasizing the interaction of three cultures--colonialists, Indians, and Blacks.</p><p>An authoritative, interpretive historical account of the interactions between Native Americans, African-Americans, and Whites during the colonial period.Written by highly acclaimed historian Gary B.

Recent controversies between analytics and historic-sociological approaches to the philosophy of science have not diminished its significance; in fact, it seems to me that the pragmatist component in Nagel's thinking may be helpful for efforts to develop a rapprochement between the contending schools." --Carl G.

His work is extensively published in Vanity Fair, Vogue, Interview, and Rolling Stone. His previous books include Pictures (1988, Twin Palms), Men/Women (1989, Twin Palms) and Duo (1991, Twin Palms).Whether through ads for Calvin Klein and The Gap or previous books like Picture (Twin Palms, 1988) and Men/Women (Twin Palms, 1989), the images created by Ritts have invaded pop culture. Compared with that of other international celebrity photographers, Ritts's work is arguably more sumptuous and less contrived. This large, handsomely self-covered book contains 120 beautifully reproduced duotone portraits (including three 8-page gatefolds) of a diversity of today's personalities, from Merce Cunningham to Magic Johnson, from Stephen Hawkins to Cher. Often, clothing makes the image: witness Michelle Pfieffer's Clark Gable get-up, Julia Roberts in wet men's underwear, Michael Jackson's hi-tech spacesuit, and, of course, a bare-breasted Madonna. Many of the shots are immediately recognizable because of their use in Vanity Fair, Interview, and Rolling Stone , magazines Ritts contributes to often. With the extraordinary talent on display in this latest work, Ritts has become as notable, if not notorious, as his subjects. Highly recommended for popular culture or photography collections.<br><i>- David Nudo, "Library Journal"</i><br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Nursing Theories: The Base for Professional Nursing Practice</h2><p><p>Completely updated in a new edition, <b> <i> <b>Nursing Theories<i> 6/e</i> </b> </i> </b>&nbsp; incoporates the latest&nbsp;theories and research methods in nursing today.

Indeed, the reactions to the book now constitute a considerable secondary literature themselves. In the long-awaited second edition of this book, George Steiner offers a complete revision, an updated bibliography, and a new preface in which he places his groundbreaking work in the present context of poetics, hermeneutics, and translation studies.<br> In the previous edition, Steiner provided readers with the first systematic investigation since the eighteenth century of the phenomenology and processes of translation both inside and between languages. Taking issue with the principal emphasis of modern linguistics, he finds the root of the "Babel problem" in our deep instinct for privacy and territory, noting that every people has in its language a unique body of shared secrecy. With this provocative thesis he analyzes every aspect of translation from fundamental conditions of interpretation to the most intricate of linguistic constructions.<br> Like the towering figures of Derrida, Lacan, and Foucault, Steiner's work is central to current literary thought. <em>After Babel</em> is essential reading for anyone hoping to understand the debates raging in the academy today.</p><p><br><strong>George Steiner</strong> is Professor of English and Comparative Literature at the University of Geneva.

Instead, he found Ch�vez Ravine, a ramshackle Mexican-American ?neighborhood tucked away in Elysian Park like a &#34;poor man&#39;s Shangri-la.&#34; Enchanted, he ?stayed for a year in this uniquely intact rural community on the city&#39;s outskirts. There, ?Normark photographed a life that, though bowed down by poverty, was lived fully, ?openly, and joyfully. That ended in 1950, when the residents of Ch�vez Ravine were ?forced to abandon their homes to make way for Dodger Stadium. The past 50 years have ?not erased the memories of the uprooted descendants of Ch�vez Ravine. This haunting ?book captures their images, their stories, and their bittersweet memories, reclaiming and ?celebrating this lost village from a simpler time.</p><p>Don Normark has had more than ten thousand photographs published in Sunset and other magazines.

For thousands of years the occupants of the barren wastes and oases that would later become the Silk Road buried their dead in the desiccating sands of the Tèklimakan, the second greatest desert on earth. This arid environment, preserving body and clothing, allows an unparalleled glimpse into the lives and appearance of a prehistoric people. While the mummies lie mute, their faces eloquently challenge modern scholars to identify them. For these are not the faces of ancient Chinese but rather those of Indo-Europeans who settled in the Tarim Basin on the western rim of ancient China some four millennia ago, 2,000 years before West and East recognized each other&#39;s existence. This intriguing study describes the discovery of these people of ancient China and reveals the latest attempts of Chinese and Western scientists to explain their origin and determine their ethnic identity. The book examines the clues left by physical remains; their economy, technology, and textiles (some of the mummies even wore tartans); and the later traces of the languages of the Tarim region. The trail ultimately leads to two major contenders: the Indo-Iranians, those masters of the Eurasian steppes who poured south into the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia, India, and China, and the Tocharians, the most elusive of the major branches of Indo-Europeans.</p><p><b>J.P.

Written by a team of plant experts, this superb book is designed to be the gardener's bible, a standard work of reference for every gardening bookshelf. It is oganized into the following sections: <p><b>Creating a Garden</b> This is a simple guide to garden planning by John Brooks, the world-renowned landscape designer. Choice of plants in relation to garden style, scale, and proportion, and use of color and texture are all explained and illustrated with a host of gardens. Extensive lists suggest plants for particular sites.</p> <p><b>The Plant Catalog</b> Organized in a unique, easy-to-use format, this section is arranged by plant type, size, season of interest, and color of flower or foliage. Over 4,000 plants are individually described, each with its own full-color photograph, symbols indicating cultivation requirements, hardiness zone numbers, and, for trees and shrubs, a scale drawing of mature size and shape.</p> <p><b>The Plant Dictionary</b> a complete A-Z guide to more than 8,000 plants, this section also functions as an index to the encyclopedia. It describes every genus in the book and provides information about thousands of other recommended plants.</p> <p><i>Plus</i> a complete index of over 2,500 common names for easy cross-reference and a glossary of straightforward definitions of the technical terms used in this book.</p></p><p>If they can afford it, libraries should have both editions of this invaluable one-volume reference. For gardeners seeking the right plant for the right place but with no knowledge of the specific name, the 1989 title arranges its catalog of 8000 plants not alphabetically by name but by season and color. It starts with color photos and descriptions of large trees, separating them by seasonal interest and by color within each season. It does the same for smaller trees, then for shrubs, climbers, perennials, annuals, rock plants, bulbs, and succulents. Expanding its coverage to over 15,000 plants, the 1997 encyclopedia is organized alphabetically, making it an ideal reference for patrons who want to know what a particular plant looks like, how it grows, and its hardiness zones. Its descriptions of popular plant species, like Narcissus, Primula, and Rhododendron, are a real strength. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Return of the King: The Lord of the Rings, Part 3: Return of the King Vol 3</h2><p>Return of the King</p><p>THE GREATEST FANTASY EPIG OF OUR TIME<p>While the evil might of the Dark Lord Sauron swarmed out to conquer all Middle-earth, Frodo and Sam struggled deep into Mordor, seat of Sauron's power.

During his legendary career, Asimov penned more than 470 books on subjects ranging from science to Shakespeare to history, though he was most loved for his award-winning science fiction sagas, which include the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series. Named a Grand Master of Science Fiction by the Science Fiction Writers of America, Asimov entertained and educated readers of all ages for close to five decades. He died, at the age of seventy-two, in April 1992.CHAPTER 1<br> &nbsp;<br> Plane<br> &nbsp;<br> It was an old plane, a four-engine plasma jet that had been retired from active service, and it came in along a route that was neither economical nor particularly safe. It nosed through the cloud banks on a trip that took it twelve hours where five might have sufficed with a rocket-powered supersonic.<br> &nbsp;<br> And there was well over an hour to go.<br> &nbsp;<br> The agent aboard knew that his part of the job wouldn&#x2019;t be finished till the plane touched down and that the last hour would be the longest.<br> &nbsp;<br> He glanced at the only other man in the large passenger cabin&#x2014;napping for the moment, with his chin buried in his chest.<br> &nbsp;<br> The passenger didn&#x2019;t look particularly striking or impressive, but at the moment, he was the most important man in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> General Alan Carter looked up glumly when the colonel walked in. Carter&#x2019;s eyes were pouchy and the corners of his mouth sagged. He tried to bend the paper clip he was manhandling back into shape and it flicked out of his hand.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Nearly got me that time,&#x201d; said Colonel Donald Reid, calmly. His sandy hair lay back smoothly but his short, graying mustache bristled. He wore his uniform with the same indefinable unnaturalness that the other did. Both were specialists, drafted for work in a super-specialty, with military rank for convenience and, considering the applications of the field, somewhat out of necessity.<br> &nbsp;<br> Both had the CMDF insignia. Each letter was in a small hexagon, two above, three below. The middle hexagon of the three bore the symbol that further classified the man. In the case of Reid, it was the caduceus that marked him as a medical man.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Guess what I&#x2019;m doing,&#x201d; said the general.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Flipping paper clips.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Sure. And counting the hours, too. Like a fool!&#x201d; His voice rose a controlled notch. &#x201c;I sit here with my hands wet, my hair sticky, my heart pounding, and I count the hours. Only now it&#x2019;s the minutes. Seventy-two minutes, Don. Seventy-two minutes and they&#x2019;re down at the airport.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;All right. Why be nervous, then? Is there anything wrong?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;No. Nothing. He was picked up safely. He was taken right out of their hands with, as far as we know, not a hitch. He got safely into the plane, an old one&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes. I know.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Carter shook his head. He wasn&#x2019;t interested in telling the other something new; he was interested in talking. &#x201c;We figured that They would figure that We would figure time was of the utmost importance, so that We would pile him into an X-52 and rocket him through inner space. Only We figured They would figure that and have the antimissile network at saturation level&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reid said, &#x201c;Paranoia, we call it in my profession. I mean, for anyone to believe They&#x2019;d do that. They&#x2019;d risk war and annihilation.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;They might risk just that to stop what&#x2019;s happening. I&#x2019;d almost feel We ought to risk it if the situation were reversed. &#x2014;So We took a commercial plane, a four-engine plasma jet. I was wondering if it could take off, it was so old.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Did it what?&#x201d; For a moment, the general had sunk into blackened thought.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take off?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, yes. It&#x2019;s coming along fine. I get my reports from Grant.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s he?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;The agent in charge. I know him.

Grant ran the whole thing; flicked Benes out of Their hands like a seed out of a watermelon.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Well, then?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;But I still worry. I tell you, Reid, there&#x2019;s only one safe way of handling matters in this darned racket. You&#x2019;ve got to believe They&#x2019;re as smart as We are; that for every trick We&#x2019;ve got, They&#x2019;ve got a counter-trick; that for every man We&#x2019;ve got planted on Their side, They&#x2019;ve got one planted on Ours. This has been going on for over half a century now; We&#x2019;ve got to be evenly matched, or it would have been all over long ago.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Take it easy, Al.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;How can I? This thing now, this thing Benes is bringing with him, this new knowledge, may end the stalemate once and for all. And with ourselves as winners.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reid said, &#x201c;I hope the Others don&#x2019;t think so, too. If They do&nbsp;...&nbsp;You know, Al, so far there have been rules to this game. One side doesn&#x2019;t do anything to back the other side into a corner so tight he has to use his missile buttons. You&#x2019;ve got to leave him a safe ledge to step back on. Push hard but not too hard. When Benes gets here, They may get the notion They&#x2019;re being pushed too hard.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;We have no choice but to risk that.&#x201d; Then, as the afterthought plagued him, &#x201c;If he gets here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;He will, won&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Carter had risen to his feet, as though to begin a hasty walk back and forth to nowhere. He stared at the other, then sat down abruptly. &#x201c;All right, why get excited? You&#x2019;ve got that tranquilizer gleam in your eye, doctor. I don&#x2019;t need any happy pills. But suppose he does get here in seventy-two&#x2014;sixty-six minutes. Suppose he lands at the airport. He&#x2019;s still got to be brought here, to be kept here, safely&nbsp;...&nbsp;There&#x2019;s many a slip&nbsp;...&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Twixt the cup and the lip,&#x201d; sing-songed Reid. &#x201c;Look here, general, shall we be sensible and talk about consequences? I mean&#x2014;what happens after he gets here?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on, Don, let&#x2019;s wait for that till he does get here.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Come on, Al,&#x201d; mimicked the colonel, an edge appearing on his own words. &#x201c;It won&#x2019;t do to wait till he gets here. It will be too late when he gets here. You&#x2019;ll be too busy, then, and all the little ants at Headquarters will start rushing about madly, so that nothing will get done where I think it needs to be done.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I promise&nbsp;...&#x201d; The general&#x2019;s gesture was a vague one of dismissal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Reid ignored it. &#x201c;No. You&#x2019;re going to be unable to keep any promise you make for the future. Call the chief now, will you? Now! You can get through to him. Right now, you&#x2019;re the only one who can get through to him. Get him to understand that CMDF isn&#x2019;t the handmaiden of defense only. Or if you can&#x2019;t, get in touch with Commissioner Furnald. He&#x2019;s on Our side. Tell him I want some crumbs for the biosciences. Point out there are votes on this. Look, Al, we&#x2019;ve got to have a voice loud enough to be heard. We&#x2019;ve got to have some fighting chance. Once Benes gets here and is jumped by all the real generals, damn them, we&#x2019;ll be out of commission forever.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t, Don. And I won&#x2019;t. &#x2014;If you want it straight, I&#x2019;m not doing a darned thing till I&#x2019;ve got Benes here. And I don&#x2019;t take it kindly your trying to put the arm on me at this time.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reid&#x2019;s lips went white. &#x201c;What am I supposed to do, general?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Wait as I am waiting. Count the minutes.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reid turned to go. His anger remained under tight control. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d reconsider the tranquilizer if I were you, general.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Carter watched him go without comment. He looked at his watch. &#x201c;Sixty-one minutes!&#x201d; he muttered, and groped for a paper clip.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was almost with relief that Reid stepped into the office of Dr. Michaels, the civilian head of the Medical Division. The expression on Michaels&#x2019; broad face might never move higher than a quiet cheerfulness accompanied by, at most, a dry chuckle, but, on the other hand, it never dropped lower than a twinkling solemnity that never took itself, it would seem, too seriously.<br> &nbsp;<br> He had the inevitable chart in his hand; or one of them. To Colonel Reid, all those charts were alike; each a hopeless maze; and taken together, they were hopelessness many times compounded.<br> &nbsp;<br> Occasionally, Michaels would try to explain the charts to him, or to almost anyone&#x2014;Michaels was pathetically eager to explain it all.<br> &nbsp;<br> The bloodstream, it seemed, was tagged with a trace of mild radioactivity and the organism (it could be a man or a mouse) then took its own photograph, so to speak, on a laserized principle that produced a three-dimensional image.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2014;Well, never mind that, Michaels would say at that point. You get a picture of the entire circulatory system in three dimensions which can then be recorded two-dimensionally in as large a number of sections and projections as would be required for the job. You could get down to the smallest capillaries, if the picture were properly enlarged.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;And that leaves me just a geographer,&#x201d; Michaels would add. &#x201c;A geographer of the human body, plotting its rivers and bays, its inlets and streams; much more complicated than anything on Earth, I assure you.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Reid looked at the chart over Michaels&#x2019; shoulder and said, &#x201c;Whose is that, Max?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one&#x2019;s to speak of.&#x201d; Michaels tossed it aside. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m waiting, that&#x2019;s all. When someone else waits, he reads a book. I read a blood system.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re waiting, too, eh? So&#x2019;s he.&#x201d; Reid&#x2019;s head nodded backward in the general direction of Carter&#x2019;s office. &#x201c;Waiting for the same thing?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;For Benes to get here. Of course. And yet, you know, I don&#x2019;t entirely believe it.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t believe what?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not sure the man has what he says he has. I&#x2019;m a physiologist, to be sure, and not a physicist,&#x201d; Michaels shrugged in self-deprecatory humor, &#x201c;but I like to believe the experts. They say there&#x2019;s no way. I hear them say that the Uncertainty Principle makes it impossible to do it for longer than a given time. And you can&#x2019;t argue with the Uncertainty Principle, can you?&#x201d;</p><h2>Webster&#39;s New World Pocket Misspeller&#39;s Dictionary</h2><p>Here's the perfect answer to the question<br>"How can I look it up in the dictionary if I can't spell it?"

From an initial policy of deliberate restraint, extending even to the active protection of Southerners&#39; property and constitutional rights, Union armies gradually adopted measures that were expressly intended to demoralize Southern civilians and to ruin the Confederate economy. Yet the ultimate &#34;hard war&#34; policy was far from the indiscriminate fury of legend. Union policy makers promoted a program of directed severity, and Professor Grimsley demonstrates how and why it worked. This volume fits into an emerging interpretation of the Civil War that questions its status as a &#34;total war&#34; and instead emphasizes the survival of political logic and control even in the midst of a sweeping struggle for the nation&#39;s future: the primary goal of the Federal government remained the restoration of the Union, not the devastation of the South. Intertwined with a political logic, and sometimes indistinguishable from it, was also a deep sense of moral justice--a belief that, whatever the claims of military necessity, the innocent deserved some pity, and that even the guilty should suffer in rough proportion to the extent of their sins. Through comparisons with earlier European wars and through the testimony of Union soldiers and Southern civilians alike, Grimsley shows that Union soldiers exercised restraint even as they made war against the Confederate civilian population.</p><p>This volume fits into an emerging interpretation of the Civil War that questions its status as a &#34;total war&#34; and emphasizes instead the survival of political logic and control even in the midst of a sweeping struggle for the nation&#39;s future.

Journal of American History<br><br>"Well researched, clearly written, and elegantly conceived, this is an important book." Choice<br><br>"Students of the Civil War continue to debate the degree to which the North embraced a strategy designed to punish the Confederacy's civilians as well as to defeat its soldiers. The Hard Hand of War is a major contribution to this debate, in which Mark Grimsley argues that northern policies and practices fit comfortably within European traditions rather than marking a dramatic break with the past. Especially useful in its discussion of factors that promoted restraint among the North's citizen-soldiers, Grimsley's book should be essential reading for anyone interested in whether the Civil War deserves to be called a 'total war.'" Gary W. Gallagher, The Pennsylvania State University<br><br>"Mark Grimsley has written the best study of how Northern policy evolved from a limited war to restore the old Union into a "hard war" to dismantle the old South and build a new free-labor nation...The writing is lucid, the argument persuasive, the analysis illuminating." James M. McPherson, Princeton University, author of Battle Cry of Freedom<br><br>"Mark Grimsley's The Hard Hand of War is the latest and best study to strip away the myth and explore the reality of Sherman's attack on the Southern civilian economy and population as a means of winning the war...Grimsley tells that story more clearly than anyone else has so far done. In lucid, straightforward prose grounded in thorough research he analyzes the evolution of Union strategy through three main phases." James M. McPherson, New York Review of Books<br><br>The 'Hard Hand of War' is an excellent account of how Northern military policy hardened over time, gradually allowing and even advocating foraging and destruction of civilian property which might aid the Southern war effort....Grimsley persuasively ties together a variety of sources to provide the best one-volume account of the origins of 'total war' in the 1860s. His book should be required reading for those who want to understand the roots of one of the more storied decisions in American military history, and would be an excellent addition to both graduate and undergraduate courses on the Civil War." Lance Janda, Journal of Military History<br><br>"Mark Grimsley challenges that old assumption by insisting that the civil war was not a total war, but a "hard war" in that the destruction of southern property was not the work of mindless human 'beasts,' but a calculated, measured attempt to demoralize the Confederate population by striking at chosen areas in order to cause surrender....Professor Grimsley has written a provocative and original book; it makes a reader look forward to more works from this rising Civil War scholar." The Civil War News<br><br>"The text of The Hard Hand of War flows with the chronology, precision, and rationale of a well-written legal brief....Mark Grimsley presents an irrefutable argument that the primary goal of the Federal government was at all times the restoration of the Union, not the devastation of the South....the result is a well-reasoned and elegantly written monograph that will take its place as one of the more important works about the Civil War to appear in years." David Long, Civil War History<br><br>"Mark Grimsley deserves respect for his keen concern with moral action in war." The Journal of Southern History<br><br>"The impact of the war on civilians is often not fully understood or misunderstood or quite deliberately misstated. So those new to the Civil War should read Mark Grimsley's The Hand of War: Union Military Policy Toward Southern Civilians, 1861-1865. It examines the intentional and unintentional effects of the conflict in a balanced, comprehensive manner."

He had hoped for a short war against Poland; instead, Britain and France declared war on Germany. </p><p>Richard Overy argues that any explanation of the outbreak of hostilities must therefore be multi-national and he shows how the war&#x2019;s origins are to be found in the basic instability of the international system that was brought about by the decline of the old empires of Britain and France and the rise of ambitious new powers, Italy, Germany and Japan, keen to build new empires of their own.</p></p><p><p> <i>The Origins of the Second World War</i> explores the reasons why the Second World War broke out in September 1939 and not sooner, and why a European war expanded into world war by 1941. </p> <p>Richard Overy argues that this was not just &#x2018;Hitler&#x2019;s War&#x2019; but one that had its roots and origins in the decline of the old empires of Britain and France and the rise of ambitious new powers in Germany, Italy and Japan.

With Susan Harding, he is editor of Histories of the Future."You may not be able to save time in a bottle, but surely it can be laid on the line. Beginning with fourth-century Christian theologian Eusebius's <i>Chronicle</i>, the timeline has been a mainstay for historians eager to visualize the temporal. In Daniel Rosenberg and Anthony Grafton's scholarly yet spirited account, we can see the church father's `image of history' recast with increasing intricacy and decorative flourishes. If some intriguing examples require viewers to decipher minuscule type and thread through labyrinthine structures, the best are often the clearest - those comprehended almost instantly. The timeline, the authors note, comes naturally to us - we think of time as inherently spatial, as long or short, with a start and a finish. Every day, every millennium, can be paced out from one side of the page to the other, or wound in a circle, as a few of these were, in fact, originally wheel charts with moving parts. Joseph Priestly constructed `A New Chart of History' (1769) with the intention of enlivening the march of the ages for viewers, showing them at a glance `all empires subsisting in the world' so they might `observe which were then rising, which were flourishing, and which were upon the decline.' While this isn't quite history written with lightening, these charts deliver whole epochs to the eye with a swiftness that belies the myriad days they condense." --Book Forum<br><br>"The first book, Cartographies of Time, is a heavily illustrated and comprehensive history of time maps, from tables and charts to cartographic illustration to the linear form we now associate with the word `timeline.' In chapter one, the authors write, `Our claim is that the line is a much more complex and colorful figure than is usually thought.' The fact that Anthony Grafton, Princeton professor and author of The Footnote (1999), is the co-author of this volume comes as no surprise. His ability to instill passion in his readers for an odd little thing like a footnote or a timeline is astonishing (much like Henry Petroski's books about bookshelves and pencils.)" --Fine Books Magazine<br><br>"It's definitely feeling like spring around here!

It laid the foundation of the Chinese idea of what is moral and what is politically viable, what is a good government and who has integrity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Featuring both the English and Chinese texts, this new translation, by one of the pre-eminent scholars of Confucius, draws on the most recent excavated manuscripts and centuries of scholarship to illuminate the historical context of Confucius&#x2019; teachings, explaining who the many local figures referenced are, and navigating a rich tradition of historical commentaries. The result is a map of Confucian thought that brings us as close as possible to experiencing Confucius as his followers might have 2,500 years ago.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

Yet for the uninitiated, this fact is hard to grasp because the principal figure in the book, Confucius, is often seen to be responding to a question, offering a comment, or just thinking aloud. He refrained from &#x201c;putting forth theories,&#x201d; the <i>Analects</i> says, and &#x201c;did not think that he must be right.&#x201d; His approach is personal, so that even when a simple fellow asks him a question, Confucius has &#x201c;to knock at both sides [of the question] until everything has been considered.&#x201d;</p><p>In the introduction to his translation of Montaigne&#x2019;s essays, Donald Frame tells us, &#x201c;Montaigne resists definition.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Yet this very difficulty points to one answer: that the book is the man.&#x201d; Perhaps the same is true of Confucius and the <i>Analects</i>, but the <i>Analects</i> is not a record of what Confucius wrote, only of what he said. It is, in hindsight, the way Confucius represented himself to the world, though he never intended for that to happen, since it was his disciples and generations of disciples following them who compiled the book. How then did such a work end up being the central point of reference for scholars, thinkers, rulers, political counselors, and just about anyone in the last twenty-five hundred years of Chinese history? And how did Confucius&#x2019; voice become a source of authority for the Chinese, even for the leaders of the present Communist government? Through a combination of hard work and chance, one might say.</p><p>In the years right after his death in 479 BC, competitive interpretations of what Confucius had taught helped to keep his name and his ideas alive. Then, in the next two hundred years, two followers, Mencius and Xunzi, took his teachings in different directions, and between them much ground was covered, from the self to society and nature. These men&#x2019;s disquisitions on man&#x2019;s inborn dispositions, on his private and public duties, on what is fair and what is misguided judgment, and on the many moral conundrums of life could seem like a long stretch from what Confucius had originally put forth, but the world had changed by their time. People demanded more from the wise and learned because there were more variables in human relationships and in one&#x2019;s relation to the state. Also, more contenders had entered the field&#x2014;but Mencius and Xunzi were not just eyeing the opposition. They had to be ready, of course, to spar with the quickest and most discerning minds of their day, but, more important, they were looking to satisfy their yearning for knowledge. In the course of their endeavor, Confucius would grow in name and stature.</p><p>Imperial patronage in the Han dynasty, after China became a unified country in the second century BC, helped Confucius secure a permanent place within China&#x2019;s institutions. Bureaucracy, law, education, social organization, and ritual practice&#x2014;all stood on principles that bore the influence of Confucius&#x2019; assumptions and beliefs. This, however, does not mean that Confucius&#x2019; teachings did not go through periods of decline. The longest of these lasted nearly seven hundred years, from the beginning of the Six Dynasties (220&#x2013;589) to the end of the Tang dynasty (618&#x2013;906), during which time Buddhism, a foreign religion, captivated the Chinese imagination and the Chinese, in turn, shaped the foreign religion to look like their own. It was in response to the imminent threat of losing their cultural distinction that the Chinese in the beginning of the Song dynasty (960&#x2013;1279) saw a need to revive Confucian teachings. The movement unfolded gradually, and by the end of that dynasty nearly everything was being addressed by this new Confucianism, from the arcane to the practical, from metaphysics to spiritual cultivation, from scholarship to learning and education, from the selection of officials to principles of government.</p><p>The Confucian counselors in the next dynasty, the Yuan (1279&#x2013;1368), managed to persuade their Mongol rulers to tighten the focus of the civil service examinations, limiting them to four books from the Confucian canon and a set of commentaries sanctioned by the imperial court. The <i>Analects</i> was one of these Four Books. In a society where, for most men, succeeding in the examinations&#x2014;and thus securing a government post&#x2014;was the only avenue to raising one&#x2019;s social standing, what this meant was that the <i>Analects</i>, along with the three related texts, became a fixture in the studies of all those who were able to get an education. These hopeful aspirants would memorize the text when they were very young and then return to it repeatedly almost as a daily exercise. In time, the book would have helped them to shape their views and might even have helped them to find a moral anchor. But the story of the <i>Analects</i> does not end there. If competition against a foreign religion fueled the Confucian revival in the Song, disagreements within the tradition about how to read the <i>Analects</i> kept the book alive, and the man who started it all vigorous and relevant, until today.</p><p>Most of the translations in English, however, do not reflect this rich tradition in reading the <i>Analects</i>. Instead, they tend to favor one commentary, Zhu Xi&#x2019;s from the twelfth century, that had become standard through five hundred years of imperial support and the only interpretation the state would accept in the civil service examinations. My work follows a different approach. I relied on the scholars from the last three hundred years&#x2014;scholars who put research before ideology&#x2014;to show me the competing interpretations and the possibilities of understanding a word, a sentence, or a passage, and my translation is what I arrived at after I had considered the range of choices before me. My hope, of course, is to recover some of the ambiguities and nuances in what Confucius says, which are often lost if one comes to trust a single voice or a single vision.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>In the introduction to this translation, I offer a brief account of Confucius&#x2019; life and some guidance about how to read the <i>Analects</i>. I also explain why one would need traditional commentaries to make sense of this book and how I have tried to handle the bulk of this knowledge and scholarship from the last two thousand years. A chronology of China&#x2019;s dynastic history follows the introduction.</p><p>Very few chapters, called &#x201c;Books&#x201d; in the translation, have a prefatory synopsis, because often there is no thread to bind the ideas together in any given section; therefore, unless there is a good reason to suggest one, I have refrained from providing a synopsis lest it become an obstacle, a limitation or misdirection, to reading. Glossaries of names and terms carry the same risk, I feel, and so my approach is to provide in the commentary a thorough description of a name or a term when it first appears in the text, and then to gloss it each time it shows up again. This is my attempt to think aloud about the character of, say, a disciple like Zigong or Zilu and about what Confucius means by <i>ren</i> (humaneness) or <i>ming</i> (destiny). My hope is that by the end of the book the reader will have come to his or her own conclusion about a given person or idea. I have, however, drawn together, in Appendix 1, an index of the disciples of Confucius and of historical individuals that appear in the <i>Analects</i>; in Appendix 2, an index of terms and of topics; and, in Appendix 3, an index of Chinese scholars and thinkers cited in the commentaries. I have also included, following my English translation, the Chinese text of the <i>Analects</i>, because more and more readers in the West have shown an interest in having it, and it is also the right thing to do in a work in which exegesis&#x2014;as a discipline and by way of translation&#x2014;is the principal mode of operation.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>For a book as old as the <i>Analects</i>, many questions remain&#x2014;about its origin and development, and about the work that went into producing its early redactions before it took its present shape. We have, through archaeological discovery, a version of one early redaction, dated to the first half of the first century BC. Written on bamboo strips, the text was found in 1973 in Ding prefecture, Hebei province, in the tomb of a Han dynasty nobleman, but it was in bad shape. A fire from long ago in the tomb&#x2014;which bore the vestiges of a botched robbery&#x2014;had destroyed more than half of the bamboo strips and left the remaining ones gravely damaged. It took scholars two decades to have the transcription of the Dingzhou <i>Analects</i> published. Comparing this and the received version, we notice variants in the usage of particles and characters and in the partition of the passages but no fundamental differences that would alter our thinking about the standard text.</p><p>Since the discovery in Ding prefecture, many more excavated texts have come to light. Some of these have been dated to the first hundred years of the Han dynasty. Others are from 300 BC or earlier, in a period of Chinese history known as &#x201c;the Warring States.&#x201d; Confucius appears in eight of the forty-five Warring States texts from the Shanghai Museum collection, most of which are records of his conversations with disciples or political figures. They add to our knowledge of Confucius and his world and have contributed to my own consideration of the <i>Analects</i>, but answers to questions regarding the formation of the <i>Analects</i> still await the emergence of more evidence. A correction in approach, however, has already taken place. It had been widely accepted that a work with a long history, like the <i>Analects</i> or the <i>Laozi</i>, even before it became stabilized, must have evolved linearly from a single mother source. But more and more scholars are giving up this theory, because the excavated materials, especially those of the <i>Laozi</i>, suggest that at inception there were many threads and mutual influences. What this means for the <i>Analects</i> is that the search for its beginnings will be more difficult than we thought, but the odds of finding more early examples may be on our side. In the meantime, we still have a lot to absorb from the book that we have right here.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Acknowledgments</p><p>I am indebted to my grandfather, Jin Yufu, and to scholars like him whose passion for research is big and constant and infectious. </p><p>I am grateful to my editor, John Siciliano, who always had time for me to talk through a point, an idea, or a change of mind about form or content.

He has read every draft and pored over every word, and to him this translation is dedicated. </p><p></p><p></p><p>Introduction</p><p>I have been exploring the <i>Analects</i> of Confucius for most of my adult life&#x2014;more obsessively in the last ten years&#x2014;and though the journey has not gotten easier, the pleasure never diminishes. This is because the more I burrow into it the more generous the text becomes, the more knowledge it is willing to give away. Confucius, too, allows himself to be that much more palpable when I search for him with extra effort. But this is what I always wanted, to find him not as an elevated idea but as someone who thinks and speaks and responds to the world with human instincts and an awareness of his own limitations. And in my long relationship with the <i>Analects</i>, something else&#x2014;something even more important&#x2014;has happened. It seems that somewhere along the way the book has shed its earlier identity as an object of my studies. In fact, as I read it now, I plunge deeper into my own life. I feel more acutely those things that make up this life: family, friends, students, my country, her politics, memories of childhood, and memories of my parents.</p><p>The eighteenth-century scholar Cheng Yaotian says this about literature: &#x201c;Its influence can be more inspiring than being in the presence of a great man because it calls upon us to articulate our ideas and it beckons us to draw analogies. And so what literature offers is more than just something to rely on: it takes us by the hand and bolsters us up; it holds us by the arm to get us on our way.&#x201d; The <i>Analects</i> is that kind of literature, yet it is also a book with few points of access. To find a way in can be discouraging even for the most earnest beginners, and it is not because the language is abstruse. The <i>Analects</i> is not a store of esoteric knowledge. It is a work about Confucius&#x2019; life and teachings, but the records stand piecemeal&#x2014;as a bit of a conversation Confucius had with a disciple or someone he knew or as part of a remark he made about a contemporary or a figure from the past. And the fragments are often isolated from one another even though they may be bundled together as a single chapter. This is one reason why the book is difficult to approach. Names of people pose another problem. Of these, there are many, and rarely does the text explain who these people were, and only in a few instances are we told why a person was mentioned or why a conversation took place at all. The heaps of commentaries written over the last two thousand years to help us get through the opaque passages and work out the enigmas can paralyze the reader with their sheer weight and volume. And this is where I would like to come in: to bring clarity to this work with a new translation and commentaries that reflect centuries of scholarship but without the heft. And my hope is to be able to take readers through each chapter and entry, without ever losing them. One example from Book Fourteen may help to illustrate this point:</p><p>A young boy from Que took on the task of being a messenger [for the people] of this district. Someone asked Confucius, &#x201c;Do you see him as someone who is eager to make progress in his learning?&#x201d;</p><p>The Master replied, &#x201c;I have seen this boy sitting down [in a gathering of adults] and walking abreast of his elders. He is not someone who seeks to make progress [<i>yi</i>]. He simply wants to grow up fast [<i>cheng</i>].&#x201d;</p><p>The two words <i>yi</i> and <i>cheng</i> are critical to our understanding of Confucius&#x2019; assessment of the young boy. But before he pronounces the boy to be <i>cheng </i>and not <i>yi</i>, Confucius says that he has seen this child &#x201c;sitting down with&#x201d; his elders and &#x201c;walking abreast of&#x201d; them, which, according to the mores at the time, was a violation of ritual propriety. Thus the boy, in Confucius&#x2019; view, could not have been someone who was &#x201c;eager to make progress in learning [<i>yi</i>]&#x201d;: &#x201c;He simply wants to grow up fast [<i>cheng</i>].&#x201d; Evidence is crucial to judgment. Confucius applied this principle to the judgment of character, and scholars later on extended it to the reading of a text. But the idea is the same, and this is how we get the moral thinker and the exegete. There is on...</p></p><h2>Indoor Marijuana Horticulture: The Indoor Bible</h2><p>The new edition is completely rewritten, beginning to end.

It is the physical, chemical and biochemical properties of cells and tissues that determine the physiological responses to exercise, and yet the teaching of exercise biochemistry is poorly developed compared with its focus on thermodynamics, chemical structures and metabolic pathways. Many students find the subject difficult, when it should not be so. The aim of this book is to introduce the student of sports science or exercise physiology to the biochemical processes that underpin exercise performance and the adaptations that occur with training. The focus is on skeletal muscle metabolism and the provision of energy for working muscles. We have tried in this book to introduce the principles of exercise biochemistry in a context that is immediately relevant to the student of sports science. This has meant abandoning the traditional approach of working through the main classes of biomolecules and the major metabolic pathways. Instead, we have tackled the subject by considering the biochemical processes involved in energy provision for different sports events and the way in which limitations in the energy supply can cause fatigue and thus limit performance. Recovery from exercise is important for athletes who train and compete with only a limited rest period, and the biochemical processes that fuel the different activities that contribute to sport are the focus of this book, together with the changes that occur with training and the role of diet in providing the necessary fuels. Sporting talent is a rare gift inherited by the elite athlete from his or her parents, and a brief description of the basis of heredity is included.</p><p><br><strong>Michael Gleeson</strong> is Professor of Exercise Biochemistry, and <strong>Ronald Maughan</strong> is Professor of Human Physiology, both at the School of Sport and Exercise Sciences, Loughborough University, UK.<br>&#39;The great strength and appeal of this book is that it beautifully brings together, like a seamless garment, the performance, the physiology and the biochemistry of the main different categories of sport, involving respectively strength, power, speed, endurance and multiple sprint game sports...this is a superb book - totally readable, highly relevant interesting view of biochemistry as defined by patterns of sporting activity.

Kennedy. But during the same week that the world stood transfixed by the possibility of nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union, Kennedy was also consumed by a war that has escaped history's attention, yet still significantly reverberates today: the Sino-Indian conflict.</p><p>As well-armed troops from the People's Republic of China surged into Indian-held territory in October 1962, Kennedy ordered an emergency airlift of supplies to the Indian army. He engaged in diplomatic talks that kept the neighboring Pakistanis out of the fighting. The conflict came to an end with a unilateral Chinese cease-fire, relieving Kennedy of a decision to intervene militarily in support of India.</p><p>Bruce Riedel, a CIA and National Security Council veteran, provides the first full narrative of this crisis, which played out during the tense negotiations with Moscow over Cuba. He also describes another, nearly forgotten episode of U.S. espionage during the war between India and China: secret U.S. support of Tibetan opposition to Chinese occupation of Tibet. He details how the United States, beginning in 1957, trained and parachuted Tibetan guerrillas into Tibet to fight Chinese military forces. The United States did not abandon this covert support until relations were normalized with China in the 1970s.</p><p>Riedel tells this story of war, diplomacy, and covert action with authority and perspective. He draws on newly declassified letters between Kennedy and Indian leader Jawaharlal Nehru, along with the diaries and memoirs of key players and other sources, to make this the definitive account of JFK's forgotten crisis. This is, Riedel writes, Kennedy's finest hour as you have never read it before.</p></p><p><p><b>Bruce Riedel</b> is senior fellow and director of the Brookings Intelligence Project.

In them you'll encounter some of Wodehouse's favourite characters - including, for the first time, his future hero Uncle Fred. The collection is widely regarded as one of Wodehouse's best and includes one of his own favourites, 'The Amazing Hat Mystery'.</p></p><p>Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (always known as `Plum&#39;) wrote more than ninety novels and some three hundred short stories over 73 years. He is widely recognised as the greatest 20th-century writer of humour in the English language. Perhaps best known for the escapades of Bertie Wooster and Jeeves, Wodehouse also created the world of Blandings Castle, home to Lord Emsworth and his cherished pig, the Empress of Blandings. His stories include gems concerning the irrepressible and disreputable Ukridge; Psmith, the elegant socialist; the ever-so-slightly-unscrupulous Fifth Earl of Ickenham, better known as Uncle Fred; and those related by Mr Mulliner, the charming raconteur of The Angler&#39;s Rest, and the Oldest Member at the Golf Club. In 1936 he was awarded the Mark Twain Prize for `having made an outstanding and lasting contribution to the happiness of the world&#39;. He was made a Doctor of Letters by Oxford University in 1939 and in 1975, aged 93, he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II. He died shortly afterwards, on St Valentine&#39;s Day.The 11 stories in this collection are classic Wodehouse. This means they are hysterically funny, but his writing style places special demands on a reader. Can a narrator deliver silly names like Cyril (Barmy) Fotheringay Phipps with a straight face? With gusto even? Can the distinct accents of the different British classes be mastered? Regional dialects? Happily, the answer to each of these is yes, due to Jonathan Cecil's masterful narration. More than a reading, Cecil delivers what seems to be a full cast performance all by himself, as he shifts pace, tone, even breath quality, to bring dozens of characters to life. This recording is a rare treat.

Lazzarato calls instead for a new theory capable of explaining how signs function in the economy, in power apparatuses, and in the production of subjectivity.</p><p>Moving beyond the dualism of signifier and signified, <i>Signs and Machines</i> shows how signs act as &#x201c;sign-operators&#x201d; that enter directly into material flows and into the functioning of machines. Money, the stock market, price differentials, algorithms, and scientific equations and formulas constitute semiotic &#x201c;motors&#x201d; that make capitalism's social and technical machines run, bypassing representation and consciousness to produce social subjections and semiotic enslavements.</p><p>Lazzarato contrasts Deleuze and Guattari's complex semiotics with the political theories of Jacques Ranci�re, Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt, Paolo Virno, and Judith Butler, for whom language and the public space it opens still play a fundamental role. Lazzarato asks: What are the conditions necessary for political and existential rupture at a time when the production of subjectivity represents the primary and perhaps most important work of capitalism? What are the specific tools required to undo the industrial mass production of subjectivity undertaken by business and the state? What types of organization must we construct for a process of subjectivation that would allow us to escape the hold of social subjection and machinic enslavement? In addressing these questions, <i>Signs and Machines</i> takes on a task that is today more urgent than ever.</p></p><p>Maurizio Lazzarato is a sociologist and philosopher in Paris. He is the author of <i>Governing by Debt</i> and <i>Signs and Machines: Capitalism and the Production of Subjectivity</i>, both published by Semiotext(e).</p><h2>Gram�tica para la composici�n (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>Integrating grammar and composition, this comprehensive new edition guides the advanced student through progressively more complex types of writing by organizing the grammar lessons on a functionalist basis around the needs of composition.

With complete, insightful information for both freshwater and saltwater anglers at all levels of experience, it is the only authoritative, and up-to-date fishing encyclopedia available. More than 2,000 detailed entries and over 1,400 color illustrations and photos cover every aspect of fishing today, including fish species, equipment, places, techniques, and a wide array of other information. Ken Schultz, internationally known fishing expert and 26-year editor at Field &amp; Stream, and his team of international experts have created the definitive fishing guide for the new millennium. Their combined expertise spans the world--from Montana to Mozambique--and is uniquely modern in scope,covering current conservation programs and issues as well as the most recent developments in technique and equipment. ""Ken Schultz's Fishing Encyclopedia is the only complete book of fishing knowledge. With expert information from cover to cover, it dwarfs every fishing book on the market. This book is indispensable."" --Vin T. Sparano, Editor Emeritus/Senior Field Editor, Outdoor Life ""A new resource for a new century, Ken Schultz's Fishing Encyclopedia is destined to become the last word in fishing information."" --Slaton White, Editor, Field &amp; Stream</p><p>Heftier than most trophy trout, Ken Schultz's thoroughly comprehensive reference may be too big to fit into your fly box, but it'll take you more places than a marlin fighting a hook. Schultz knows what he's talking about; a staffer at <i>Field &amp; Stream</i> for more than 25 years, he's held seven world fishing records at one time or another and was recently inducted into the Fishing Hall of Fame. Somewhere along the way, he put down his rod long enough to reel in more than 100 expert contributors from around the world to help compile what should be the definitive reference on all things angling for some time. <p> More than 2,200 entries cover the whole ocean--plus rivers, streams, lakes, and ponds--of sportfishing with topics ranging from technique and equipment to the fish themselves. You want the ABCs of sonar? It's here. Unsure what a Kirby hook looks like? Schultz'll show you. How do you drift fish? This is where to learn. Hundreds of species are present and accounted for, their entries accompanied by photographs and/or watercolors. Say, for example, you want to land an Atlantic Bonito. The <i>Fishing Encyclopedia</i> will tell you the fish's Latin name is <i>Sarda sarda</i>, it's a relative of tuna, and it has a reputation for putting up a fight and tasting good once you catch it. Schultz also adds detailed information on its markings, size, habitat, behavior, and feeding habits and even offers some counsel on how best to catch it. The <i>Fishing Encyclopedia</i> may not be able to physically catch something for you, but it'll tell you pretty much everything you want to know about anything--other than maybe that old shoe--you manage to land on your own. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>The most comprehensive, up-to-date fishing encyclopedia in the world today!</p><h2>Give Me Liberty!: An American History (Brief Third Edition) (Vol. 1)</h2><p><p><strong>The leading United States History survey text, now available in a brief, full-color edition.</strong></p><em>Give Me Liberty!</em> is the leading book in the market because it works in the classroom.

But <em>John Caldigate</em> has some striking and distinctive calls on the reader's attention: Australian gold-mining scenes, the prominence given to matters of law and a criminal trial, and the stronger than usual attack on religious fanaticism. Moreover, the main character is accused of and standing trial for bigamy on the testimony of his former mistress.</p><p>&#39;John Caldigate&#39; (1879) possesses in abundance the virtues of Trollope&#39;s writing: an attention-holding story told by a worldly-wise, kindly, fair-minded narrator, and a tale strong on what Trollope claimed as the leading feature of his novels, &#39;real&#39; characters. While no Trollope novel can accurately be labeled a &#39;sensation novel, &#39; &#39;John Caldigate, &#39; the novel of a man accused of and standing trial for bigamy on the testimony of his former mistress, comes pretty close.As young adult, Trollope endured seven years of poverty in the General Post Office in London before accepting a better-paying position as postal surveyor in Banagher, Ireland in 1841. The years in Ireland formed the basis of his second career delineating clerical life in small cathedral towns.</p><h2>A Timbered Choir: The Sabbath Poems, 1979-1997</h2><p>A collection of poems written outdoors on Sunday mornings over a span of more than two decades explores the beauty and spirituality of the natural world</p><p>The public performance of poetry, writes Wendell Berry in the preface to <i>A Timbered Choir</i>, has become vogue in the English-speaking world.

This volume gathers nearly 20 years' worth of Berry's Sabbath poems, written after Sunday morning walks across the fields and bottomlands of northern Kentucky.Wendell Berry lives and works with his wife, Tanya Berry, on their farm in Port Royal, Kentucky.

It has contributed to a significant reduction in AIDS-related mortality and allowed many previously bed-ridden patients to live healthier, more productive lives. Until the advent of HAART in 1996, a diagnosis of HIV infection was considered a death sentence. A decade later, the disease has been transformed into a serious, yet potentially manageable, medical condition for thousands of people living with HIV/AIDS in the developed world - almost overnight creating a generation of "HIV Survivors" - and forged a global movement to ensure that its Lazarus-like benefit reaches millions more in the developing world. <br><br>This book reviews the achievements of HAART over the past decade, and explores the challenges that may arise in the future. It recounts key landmarks in the development and introduction of HAART from the perspective of clinicians, researchers, economists, sociologists, and public policy experts, including the co-discoverers of HIV, Luc Montagnier and Robert Gallo. It explores the evolution of the disease, the evolution of HIV treatment, and the economic, social, and public policy impacts of both HIV and the introduction of HAART.<br></p><p>Jose M.

It was an era marked by polarization and posturing fueled by deep-rooted anger and insecurity.<br> <br> Buchanan&#x2019;s fiery speech marked a high point in the culture wars, but as Andrew Hartman shows in this richly analytical history, their roots lay farther back, in the tumult of the 1960s&#x2014;and their significance is much greater than generally assumed. Far more than a mere sideshow or shouting match, the culture wars, Hartman argues, were the very public face of America&#x2019;s struggle over the unprecedented social changes of the period, as the cluster of social norms that had long governed American life began to give way to a new openness to different ideas, identities, and articulations of what it meant to be an American. The hot-button issues like abortion, affirmative action, art, censorship, feminism, and homosexuality that dominated politics in the period were symptoms of the larger struggle, as conservative Americans slowly began to acknowledge&#x2014;if initially through rejection&#x2014;many fundamental transformations of American life.<br> <br> As an ever-more partisan but also an ever-more diverse and accepting America continues to find its way in a changing world, <i>A War for the Soul of America</i> reminds us of how we got here, and what all the shouting has really been about.</p></p><p><b>Andrew Hartman</b> is associate professor of history at Illinois State University and the author of <i>Education and the Cold War: The Battle for the American School</i>."A lively chronicle. . . . Mr. Hartman's book makes two major contributions. The first is his framing of the &#x2018;culture wars&#x2019; debate from its earliest days. . . . His second major contribution is his conclusion that the culture wars are over." (<i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"As a guide to the late twentieth-century culture wars, Hartman is unrivalled. . . . Incisive portraits of individual players in the culture wars dramas. . . . Reading Hartman sometimes feels like debriefing with friends after a raucous night out, an experience punctuated by laughter, head-scratching, and moments of regret for the excesses involved." (<i>New Republic</i>)<br><br>"A provocative review of a formative epoch." (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>"A valuable addition to the growing body of literature historicizing the post-Sixties era. . . . Classic intellectual history. . . . Thoughtful and thought-provoking." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"An unparalleled guide . . . making sense of the polarized politics that have plagued the USA for the past four decades. . . . Hartman's central point is that the debates were deadly serious, asking fundamental questions abotu who we are as a nation, and about who we want to be. . . . In his efforts to provide an overview and explanation of the culture wars, Hartman is to date without peer." (Kevin M. Schultz <i>The Sixties</i>)<br><br>"Hartman's text is nothing less than required reading on the culture wars, their history, and their impact on American public life." (L. Benjamin Rolsky <i>H-Net Reviews</i>)<br><br>"The frist book to tell the story of this war in all its diversity. . . . Hartman, to his credit, insists that the issues at stake in cultural politics are 'real and compelling.' . . . His affections clearly rest with the liberals, but he is generally nonpoloemical in his accounts of the two sides." (<i>Christian Century</i>)<br><br>"Andrew Hartman has worked with a deft hand and a keen mind to give us an absorbing account of the last half-century of culture wars in the United States. By digging far beneath the cross-fire style of political rhetoric that bombards us today, Hartman shows how the seismic changes in American society, most notably in the struggle to create a more equal and inclusive democracy, unleashed a fierce conservative attempt to hold on to a world that was escaping their grip." (Gary Nash, author of History on Trial)<br><br>"Whatever happened to the culture wars? Americans don't argue the way they used to, at least not over hot-button cultural issues like same-sex marriage and abortion. Andrew Hartman has produced both a history and a eulogy, providing a new and compelling explanation for the rise and fall of the culture wars. But don't celebrate too soon. On the ashes of the culture wars, we've built a bleak and acquisitive country dedicated to individual freedom over social democracy. Anyone who wants to take account of the culture wars--or to wrestle with their complicated legacy--will also have to grapple with this important book." (Jonathan Zimmerman, author of Whose America?)<br><br>"<i>A War for the Soul of America</i> illuminates the most contentious issues of the last half of the twentieth century. In lively, elegant prose, Andrew Hartman explains how and why the consensus that appeared to permeate the nation following World War II frayed and fractured so dramatically in the 1960s. With keen insight and analysis, he shows that the Culture Wars were not marginal distractions from the main issues of the day. Rather, they were profound struggles over the very foundation of what it meant to be an American. In tracing the history of those conflicts over the last half of the twentieth century, Hartman provides a new understanding of the tensions and processes that transformed the nation."

King, Jerry Garcia, Chet Atkins, and many others. Yet there is no major biography of Reinhardt. <br><br>Now, in <em>Django</em>, Michael Dregni offers a definitive portrait of this great guitarist. Handsome, charismatic, childlike, and unpredictable, Reinhardt was a character out of a picaresque novel. Born in a gypsy caravan at a crossroads in Belgium, he was almost killed in a freak fire that burned half of his body and left his left hand twisted into a claw. But with this maimed left hand flying over the frets and his right hand plucking at dizzying speed, Django became Europe's most famous jazz musician, commanding exorbitant fees--and spending the money as fast as he made it. Dregni not only chronicles this remarkably colorful life--including a fascinating account of gypsy culture--but he also sheds much light on Django's musicianship. He examines his long musical partnership with violinist Stphane Grappelli--the one suave and smooth, the other sharper and more dissonant--and he traces the evolution of their novel string jazz ensemble, <em>Quintette du Hot Club de France</em>. Indeed, the author spotlights Django's amazing musical diversity, describing his swing-styled Nouveau Quintette, his big band Django's Music, and his later bebop ensemble, as well as his many compositions, including symphonic pieces influenced by Ravel and Debussy and his unfinished organ mass inspired by Bach. And along the way, the author offers vivid snapshots of the jazz scene in Paris--colorful portraits of Josephine Baker, Bricktop, Louis Armstrong, Coleman Hawkins, and countless others--and of Django's vagabond wanderings around France, Europe, and the United States, where he toured with Duke Ellington. <br><br>Capturing the extraordinary life and times of one of the great musicians of the twentieth century, <em>Django</em> is a must-read portrait of a true original.<br></p><p><br><strong>Michael Dregni</strong> is a writer for <em>Vintage Guitar</em> magazine; his work has also appeared in Acoustic Guitar, Guitar Player, and <em>The Utne Reader</em>, among other publications. He lives in Minneapolis, Minnesota.<br><br>"One of the most satisfying jazz biographies in recent years.... Dregni writes lyrically of a place where the crosscurrents of art, music and fashion collided to produce a cultural richness that happens only once or twice a century, if humans are lucky.... Rich and rewarding."--<em>Baltimore Sun</em><p></p><br>"Extremely informative.... An important appreciation of an oft-forgotten musician.... Dregni carefully dissects Reinhardt's virtuoso playing style without resorting to technical jargon, and he spends plenty of time tending to Reinhardt's passionate soul--artistic, gypsy and otherwise."--Mitch Myers, <em>DownBeat</em><p></p><br>"A rags-to-riches story of a unique talent whose works continue to touch aspiring guitarists of all genres."--<em>Library Journal</em> (starred review)<p></p><br>"A compelling portrait of this colorful musician, one that gives equal time to Reinhardt's fascinating story as well as ample musical analysis."--<em>JazzTimes</em><p></p><br>"An encyclopedic account of the Gypsy jazzman's life and times that provides an abundance of new information, finds new connections between what was already known, and clears up many misconceptions along the way."--<em>Guitar Player</em><p></p><br>"In many ways the book jazz enthusiasts have been waiting for.... Fascinating and well-written. Dregni's musical analysis will send fans running to the stereo, digging out the old recordings and listening with fresh ears. Guitarists will have a feast reading about Django's technique and his famous Selmer Maccaferri guitar. Although Django will always be a larger-than-life figure, Dregni has given us a much clearer picture of the man behind the myth. 'Django' is, for now, the definitive biography, and we are in Dregni's debt for considerably advancing our understanding of the remarkable Django Reinhardt, his music and the world he lived in."--David French, <em>Los Angeles Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"Dregni's biography does his complex subject justice.... His immersion in the period's history enriches his storytelling and our understanding. The panoramic results present Django Reinhardt as he has never been seen.... Dregni clarifies a lot of history while weaving an illuminated web of contexts around his subject. He vividly describes Gypsy life and mores, and anti-Gypsy bigotry; unearths new aspects of Reinhardt's life and work; discusses Parisian musette, American 'hot' jazz and bebop, and classical music; and insightfully details the music Reinhardt made and the instruments and people he made it with."--Gene Santoro, <em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br>"There was only one Django Reinhardt, and Dregni supplies a vivid, detailed portrait of the man behind the guitar.... Dregni has given us Reinhardt the man--rascal, scoundrel, transcendent improviser, failed human being."--Joel Selvin, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em><p></p><br>"The great strength of his book is his tireless research into the world of Django's gypsy roots. He has tracked down and interviewed as many of Reinhardt's relatives as he can find, as well as older gypsies who knew and worked with him. The result is a more complete portrait of Reinhardt's inner life, including his relationships with his parents, his wife and many other women, and two sons. There is even a detailed account of the tragic fire that cost him two fingers.... <em>Django</em> is a remarkable book, and its outsider's perspective is part of the reason."--<em>New York Sun</em><p></p><br>"In this carefully researched biography, rich with details from interviews with family members, friends and musicians, Dregni brings legendary Gypsy jazz guitarist Django Reinhardt into the spotlight.... Dregni casts Django as a mercurial, charismatic Romany innocent, alternately transfixed by dajo life and dismissive of it. Colorful descriptions of the nightclubs of jazz-age Paris and sensitive appraisals of Django's musicianship add to the book's appeal."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"The book is alive from beginning to end, and after awhile you feel like you were there as Django's career unfolds.

Dregni clears up the two much mystified areas of Django's life--what exactly he did during the Second World War, and what really happened on his one trip to America, in 1946--and he sorts through the music and, nice bonus, manages to suggest plots for at least three fine French movie musicals."--Adam Gopnik, <em>The New Yorker</em><p></p><br>"Uncovers the influences that helped fuse Reinhardt's unique talent and background with a developing music scene that would eventually become a lasting art form."--<em>Vintage Guitar Magazine</em><p></p><br>"Present[s] Reinhardt's life and mythology with a clarity and detail previously lacking."--<em>All About Jazz</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Writing for the TOEFL iBT: With MP3 CD, 6th Edition (Barron&#39;s Test Prep)</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.</b><br><br> This updated manual prepares students to succeed on the TOEFL's Independent Task, the all-important essay question, and on the Integrated Task, which combines reading, listening, and writing skills.<br><br>The author presents a three-step program designed to help students write like native speakers of English.

It also includes range maps &amp; botanical keys for summer &amp; winter.The state of Georgia encompasses five distinct geographical areas, providing a great diversity of climate, topography, and soils. The seasonal climate on mountain summits in northern Georgia is comparable to that of some states in the Northeast, while that of the Coastal Islands is nearly subtropical. This diversity has fostered a similar richness in native tree species: some 205 species and varieties, nearly one-third of the total native in the entire United States. <p>Brown and Kirkman&#x2019;s new manual is intended as a practical, concise guide for field identification. Unlike any other manual, it presents color photographs of fruits and flowers as well as leaves of most species, along with bark characteristics of significant commercial species. It also presents photographs of winter twigs, which in conjunction with the winter key that supplements the summer key makes the book valuable year-round. The descriptions of each species are detailed, including information on habitat and economic and ornamental uses. A feature of particular usefulness is &#x201c;Recognition Difficulties with Other Taxa,&#x201d; where characteristics of similar plants are compared and contrasted to make identification certain. </p><p>The book&#x2019;s usefulness is by no means restricted to Georgia: about 90% of the native tress to be found in the states from Delaware south to Northern Florida and westward to east Texas are included. The manual will therefore be of great interest to botanists, horticulturists, and foresters throughout the Southeast.</p></p><h2>A Prehistory of the Cloud (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p><b>The militarized legacy of the digital cloud: how the cloud grew out of older network technologies and politics.</b></p><p>We may imagine the digital cloud as placeless, mute, ethereal, and unmediated. Yet the reality of the cloud is embodied in thousands of massive data centers, any one of which can use as much electricity as a midsized town. Even all these data centers are only one small part of the cloud. Behind that cloud-shaped icon on our screens is a whole universe of technologies and cultural norms, all working to keep us from noticing their existence. In this book, Tung-Hui Hu examines the gap between the real and the virtual in our understanding of the cloud. </p><p>Hu shows that the cloud grew out of such older networks as railroad tracks, sewer lines, and television circuits. He describes key moments in the prehistory of the cloud, from the game &#x201c;Spacewar&#x201d; as exemplar of time-sharing computers to Cold War bunkers that were later reused as data centers. Countering the popular perception of a new &#x201c;cloudlike&#x201d; political power that is dispersed and immaterial, Hu argues that the cloud grafts digital technologies onto older ways of exerting power over a population. But because we invest the cloud with cultural fantasies about security and participation, we fail to recognize its militarized origins and ideology. Moving between the materiality of the technology itself and its cultural rhetoric, Hu's account offers a set of new tools for rethinking the contemporary digital environment.</p></p><p>Tung-Hui Hu, a former network engineer, is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Michigan and the recipient of a 2015 NEA literature fellowship.<p>Before we dismantle the cloud in our fight against the centralization of power, it's crucial to know its history. Thanks to Tung-Hui Hu's excellent book, <i>A Prehistory of the Cloud</i>, we now do.</p>&#x2015;<b>Geert Lovink</b>, media theorist<br><br><p>Hu's riveting genealogy of the cloud takes us into its precursors and politics, and boldly demonstrates how fantasies of sovereignty, security, and participation are bound up in it. Much more than a data center, the cloud is a diffuse and invisible structure of power that has yielded a data-centric order. Imaginative and lucidly written, this book will be core to digital media studies.</p>&#x2015;<b>Lisa Parks</b>, Professor of Film and Media Studies, University of California, Santa Barbara<br><br><p>Tung-Hui Hu's <i>A Prehistory of the Cloud</i> is a powerful genealogy of the historical infrastructure underlying the image of the cloud as disembodied, virtual object&#x2015;an image that has come to dominate the Internet of social networks, algorithms, and big data. If looking right into the cloud might blind us, there is much worth in understanding how this 'amorphous form' has come to signify the nebulous character of network societies while also materially and symbolically reinventing old modes of power. Beautifully and yet plainly written, both abstract and concrete, Hu's <i>A Prehistory of the Cloud </i>is bound to be an enduring contribution to our historical and political understanding of network technologies.</p>&#x2015;<b>Tiziana Terranova</b>, author of <i>Network Culture: Politics for the Information Age</i></p><h2>Cecilia, or Memoirs of an Heiress (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>Cecilia is an heiress, but she can only keep her fortune if her husband will consent to take her surname. Fanny Burney's unusual love story and deft social satire was much admired on its first publication in 1782 for its subtle interweaving of comedy, humanity and social analysis.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years<strong> Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

In playing on the issue of the heroine&#39;s name, the novel illustrates the high cost of a patriarchal system. Burney exhibits her powers as a comic writer and a satirist in depicting Cecilia&#39;s dismaying entry into the gilded fashionable world. This edition presents &#39;Cecilia&#39; as it first appeared in 1782, indicating changes Burney made to later editions.Peter Sabor is Professor of English at Queen's University, Ontario.<br>Margaret Anne Doody is Professor of English at Princeton.</p><h2>Understanding Fiction (3rd Edition)</h2><p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td>Ample collection of short stories, with essays, notes and questions for each.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table></p><p></p><h2>Wuthering Heights, A Longman Cultural Edition</h2><p><p>From Longman's Cultural Editions series, <i>Wuthering Heights</i>, edited by Alison Booth, presents Emily Bronte&#x2019;s haunting, brilliant novel freshly edited, smartly annotated, and illuminated by various contexts.&nbsp; This illustrated edition is unique in locating <i>Wuthering Heights </i>in its region as well as period, while it follows every phase of the Bront� renown, from tourism to adaptations, from early reviews to recent critical trends.&nbsp; </p></p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

We meet oligarchs determined to translate ambitions into concrete and steel, developers for whom architecture is mere investment, and the layers of politicians, bureaucrats, consultants, and mysterious hangers-on who lie between any architectural idea and the chance of its execution.</p><p><i>Four Walls and a Roof </i> tells the story of a profession buffeted by external forces that determine&#x2015;at least as much as individual inspiration&#x2015;what architects design. Perhaps the most important myth debunked is success itself. To achieve anything, architects must serve the powers they strive to critique, finding themselves in a perpetual conflict of interest. Together, architects, developers, politicians, and consultants form an improvised world of contest and compromise that none alone can control.</p></p><p>Reinier de Graaf is Partner at the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, Rotterdam.&#x201c;Something of a revelation...[De Graaf] has produced an original and even occasionally hilarious book about losing ideals and finding them again...He deftly shows that architecture cannot be better or more pure than the flawed humans who make it.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>The Economist</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[It] tells the stories that tend to get left out of official histories, but which actually shape our physical environment...De Graaf&#x2019;s book is sharp, revealing, funny, drily passionate and not always encouraging.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Rowan Moore</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Guardian</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a book about power, money and influence, and architecture&#x2019;s complete lack of any of them. It is a book not about architecture&#x2019;s successes but about its failures. Witty, insightful and funny, it is a (sometimes painful) dissection of a profession that thinks it is still in control.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Edwin Heathcote</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;De Graaf is an excellent, witty and perceptive essayist. The heart of the book is a series of astonishing accounts of the protracted&#x2015;and as it turns out, all doomed&#x2015;sagas to get big urban projects approved and built in London (just pre-crash), Moscow (just pre-Putin), the Emirates (just pre-oil slump), and Kurdistan (just pre-Isis). The way de Graaf builds up to each (in hindsight) inevitable disappointment is masterly...He emerges as an unlikely, deeply skeptical architectural Everyman.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Hugh Pearman</b><b>, </b><b><i>The Spectator</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;This is the most stimulating book on architecture and its practice that I have read for years. Not only is de Graaf a good anecdotalist (his hilarious account of a long-winded and fruitless masterplanning competition in Russia should be turned into a film), but a perceptive analyst of how architecture represents, or connects with, wider political and economic movements and trends.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Paul Finch</b><b>, </b><b><i>Architects&#x2019; Journal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Takes an idiosyncratic look at architectural history and dissects contemporary practice&#x2015;from the quotidian (and sometimes comic) frustrations to the occasional triumphs and memorable failures.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Josephine Minutillo</b><b>, </b><b><i>Architectural Record</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Provocative...De Graaf has no fixed method. But the impressive extent and depth of his knowledge persistently inform his meditations, which take in many subjects. His mood is invariable. He is constantly and exhilaratingly cynical...Because he displays such candor&#x2015;albeit polished candor, and such a perfectly gauged lack of tact&#x2015;it is easy to forget that de Graaf is an architect, an insider, part of the system he dissects...De Graaf is likely to remain an architect for decades to come. In those circumstances, his enthusiasm for biting the hand that feeds him is admirably risky.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Jonathan Meades</b><b>, </b><b><i>Literary Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A refreshingly accessible, honest portrayal of a quixotic field from someone within the most successful architecture firm in the world today...

Most books about cryptography are organized historically, or around how codes and ciphers have been used, such as in government and military intelligence or bank transactions. Joshua Holden instead shows how mathematical principles underpin the ways that different codes and ciphers operate. Holden focuses on both code making and code breaking and he discusses the majority of ancient and modern ciphers currently known.</p><p>Holden begins by looking at substitution ciphers, built by substituting one letter or block of letters for another. Explaining one of the simplest and historically well-known ciphers, the Caesar cipher, Holden establishes the key mathematical idea behind the cipher and discusses how to introduce flexibility and additional notation. Holden goes on to explore polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, transposition ciphers, including one developed by the Spartans, connections between ciphers and computer encryption, stream ciphers, and ciphers involving exponentiation. He also examines public-key ciphers, where the methods used to encrypt messages are public knowledge, and yet, intended recipients are still the only ones who are able to read the message. He concludes with a look at the future of ciphers and where cryptography might be headed. Only basic mathematics up to high school algebra is needed to understand and enjoy the book.</p><p>With a plethora of historical anecdotes and real-world examples, <i>The Mathematics of Secrets </i>reveals the mathematics working stealthily in the science of coded messages.</p></p><p><p>"Suitable for anyone with a basic understanding of high school math, <i>The Mathematics of Secrets</i> presents the theoretical principles of cryptography, from Julius Caesar's primitive cipher to the intricacies of the modern digital signature. This terrific book is a testament to the almost supernatural power of mathematics."<b>--Paul J.

Its approach to the content helps students follow and dissect ethical arguments, think through philosophic issues, and apply theory to practice. Each chapter includes objectives, philosophical exercises, reviews, and study questions to reinforce understanding. Kretchmar's engaging writing style accentuates important topics of discussion, focusing the readers' attention on the philosophy behind the practice or strategy. As a result, students develop their philosophical skills, refine their personal philosophy concerning physical activity and sport, and learn that philosophy can be clear, practical, and holistic, rather than obscure, overly theoretical, and dualistic. </p><p>The text is arranged in four parts. <b>Part I</b> introduces students to the nature and methods of philosophy. <b>Part II</b> focuses on issues relating to the nature of the athlete or client and includes analyses of dualism, scientific materialism, and holism. <b>Part III</b> delves into kinesiology issues, including the nature of play, games, and competition, and <b>Part IV</b> provides expanded material on ethics, value choices, and active lifestyles.</p><p>This text provides students with the practical tools and specific techniques they need to think ethically and systematically, as they become skilled practitioners in the field of physical activity and sport. In doing so, it demystifies philosophy and reveals it as the guiding element in our understanding of, and approach to, activity, games, and competitions.</p></p><p><p><b>R.

Now brought back into print with an updated bibliography and bibliographical essay by Francesca R. Serra Ridgway, it remains an essential introduction for anyone interested in ancient art, history, and civilization.<br><br>Otto Brendel's exploration of the art, culture, and society of Etruria takes us through its four main periods of creativity: the Villanovan and Orientalizing era, the Archaic era, the Classical era, and the Hellenistic era, when Etruscan art became extinct. According to Brendel, the Etruscans were deeply influenced by Greek styles but used Greek forms and concepts to further their own purposes. Etruscan art is a private art, aristocratic and luxurious but centered in the life of the family and a continuing life in the tomb. Many of the art forms and objects discussed&#x2015;ceramics, metalware, jewelry, sculpture, and wall painting&#x2015;are known to us through the discovery of tombs. Most of these objects had a clearly defined function but were also designed, with a high degree of quality and craftsmanship, to be decorative. The beautiful art of the Etruscans, illustrated and explained in this book, sheds much light on a people about whom we know little.</p><p><b>Otto J. Brendel</b> held many academic positions in Europe and the United States, the last of which was as a professor at Columbia University, and he was the author of many fundamental books on ancient art.

Rather than offer details about health systems around the world without providing a theoretical context, <i>Health Economics</i> combines economic concepts with empirical evidence to enhance readers' economic understanding of how health care institutions and markets function. It views the subject in both microeconomic and macroeconomic terms, moving from the individual and firm level to the market level to a macroeconomic view of the role of health and health care within the economy as a whole.</p><p>The book includes discussion of recent empirical evidence on the U.S. health system and can be used for an undergraduate course on U.S. health economics. It also contains sufficient material for an undergraduate or masters course on global health economics, or for a course on health economics aimed at health professionals. It includes a chapter on nurses as well as a chapter on the economics of hospitals and pharmaceuticals, which can be used in master's courses for students in these fields. It supplements its analysis with readings (both classic and current), extensive references, links to Web sites on policy developments and public programs, review and discussion questions, and exercises. Downloadable supplementary material for instructors, including solutions to the exercise sets, sample syllabuses, and more than 600 slides that can be used for class presentations, is available at http://mitpress.mit.edu/health_economics.

The essence of �g�n is considered one of many Spiritual Forces in Nature which are called Orisha. There are a large number of Orisha and each Orisha has its own Awo. The unique function of �g�n within the realm of Orisha Awo (Mysteries of Nature) is to remove all obstacles that stand in the way of Spiritual evolution, which includes the evolution of all that is. In order to do this �g�n must sacrifice all that stands in the way of spiritual evolution. Because of these sacred responsibility �g�n is considered the Guardian of Truth. �g�n does not protect the truth of what we would like to be, he guards the truth of what is. It is the process of making this distinction that lies at the core of �g�n&#x2019;s mystery. <p>This title is part of a series of eight booklets about the Orisha by Awo F�&#x2019; Lokun F�tunmbi.

The pair&#x2019;s adventures after they elope paint a vivid portrait of California history and the woeful fate of Native Americans and Mexicans whose lands and rights were stripped as Anglo-Americans overran southern California. <br><br>Set from the first American edition of 1884, this Modern Library Paperback Classic includes Jos� Mart�&#x2019;s 1888 prologue (translated from the Spanish by Esther Allen).</p><p><p> <em>Ramona </em>has often been compared to <em>Uncle Tom&#x2019;s Cabin </em>for its influence on American social policy, and this is the only edition available that presents this important novel in its full historical context. A huge popular and critical success when it was first published in 1884, <em>Ramona </em>is set among the California Spanish missions and tells the story of the young mixed-blood heroine, Ramona, and her Native American lover Alessandro, as they flee from the brutal violence of white settlers. </p> <p> This Broadview edition re-examines the novel&#x2019;s legacy by placing it alongside public speeches, letters, and newspaper articles that promoted what was ultimately a damaging campaign by reformers to &#x201c;assimilate&#x201d; Native American peoples. Selections from Jackson&#x2019;s non-fiction writings call into question the link between assimilationist policies and the story told in <em>Ramona</em>; also included are the writings and testimonies of some of Jackson&#x2019;s Native American contemporaries, as well as a selection of travel essays and images that helped to create &#x201c;the Ramona myth.&#x201d; </p><b>Denise Ch�vez</b>, a prolific playwright, poet, and novelist, is the author of <i>Loving Pedro Infante</i>, <i>Face of an Angel</i>, and <i>The Last of the Menu Girls</i>.

Yet the Palestinians&#x2015;the would-be beneficiaries of a vision for a comprehensive regional settlement that led to the Camp David Accords in 1978&#x2015;remain stateless to this day. How and why Palestinian statelessness persists are the central questions of Seth Anziska&#x2019;s groundbreaking book, which explores the complex legacy of the agreement brokered by President Jimmy Carter.</p><p>Based on newly declassified international sources, <i>Preventing Palestine</i> charts the emergence of the Middle East peace process, including the establishment of a separate track to deal with the issue of Palestine. At the very start of this process, Anziska argues, Egyptian-Israeli peace came at the expense of the sovereignty of the Palestinians, whose aspirations for a homeland alongside Israel faced crippling challenges. With the introduction of the idea of restrictive autonomy, Israeli settlement expansion, and Israel&#x2019;s 1982 invasion of Lebanon, the chances for Palestinian statehood narrowed even further. The first Intifada in 1987 and the end of the Cold War brought new opportunities for a Palestinian state, but many players, refusing to see Palestinians as a nation or a people, continued to steer international diplomacy away from their cause.</p><p>Combining astute political analysis, extensive original research, and interviews with diplomats, military veterans, and communal leaders, <i>Preventing Palestine</i> offers a bold new interpretation of a highly charged struggle for self-determination.</p></p><p><p>Seth Anziska is the Mohamed S. Farsi-Polonsky Lecturer in Jewish-Muslim Relations at University College London and a visiting fellow at the U.S./Middle East Project. His writing has appeared in the New York Times, Foreign Policy, and Haaretz. He lives in London.</p>&#x201c;Brilliantly conceived and researched, <i>Preventing Palestine</i> joins a very short list of essential works on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and on U.S. relations with the Middle East.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Bradley Simpson, University of Connecticut</b><br><br>"Seth Anziska's book illuminates a crucial chapter in Middle Eastern history and U.S. foreign policy, and shows how the breakthrough peace agreement between Egypt and Israel created a roadblock to peace between Israel and the Palestinians. The breadth and depth of Anziska's research is remarkable."<b>&#x2015;Gershom Gorenberg, author of <i>The Accidental Empire: Israel and the Birth of the Settlements, 1967-1977</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Probing deep causes, <i>Preventing Palestine</i> vividly recounts the drive by Palestinians to achieve national self-determination and a parallel effort by Israelis to thwart that movement. We already know the outcome of the contest (at least so far), but Seth Anziska&#x2019;s story is gripping nonetheless. And highly revealing: for the author also lays bare the willingness of Americans and even Egyptians to go along with the Israeli campaign. Anziska transforms our understanding of recent Middle Eastern history.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Salim Yaqub, University of California, Santa Barbara</b><br><br>&#x201c;In Israel&#x2019;s animated political discourse, the Camp David Accords are universally acclaimed while the Oslo Accords are bitterly debated between Left and Right. In this perceptive, thoroughly researched book, Seth Anziska reveals the strong connection between the two agreements and the extent to which Oslo drew on Camp David&#x2019;s autonomy plan. <i>Preventing Palestine</i> is mandatory reading for understanding the complexities and ironies of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Itamar Rabinovich, author of <i>Yitzhak Rabin: Soldier, Leader, Statesman</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Preventing Palestine</i> is a must-read for understanding why a two-state solution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict hasn&#x2019;t been achieved. The book provides an objective and foreboding picture of a political reality where a people's rights are marginalized by a brazen military power unchecked by international order and largely supported by the United States. This is a story of Israel's success, but one that paradoxically leaves it facing its ever-more-assertive existential nemesis.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Sari Nusseibeh, author of <i>Once Upon a Country: A Palestinian Life</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Preventing Palestine</i> is an essential account of a reality obscured by hostile political agendas and unabashed bias. Seth Anziska uncovers the complex forces that have prevented Palestinian statehood and contributed to the destructive dynamic on the ground. With searing honesty, he traces the failures of the so-called Palestinian-Israeli peace process and describes the result: the tragic injustice inflicted on the people of Palestine. This is a historical revelation of enormous magnitude.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Hanan Ashrawi, member of the PLO Executive Committee </b><br><br>"Anziska&#x2019;s meticulous research and compelling analysis of the unexpected continuity that runs throughout the turbulent years of Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking makes this book invaluable for expert and layperson alike."<b>&#x2015;Gershon Shafir, author of <i>A Half Century of Occupation: Israel, Palestine, and the World's Most Intractable Conflict</i></b></p><h2>Fundamentals of Clinical Supervision (4th Edition)</h2><p><p>Comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and authoritative, <i>Fundamentals of Clinical Supervision </i>continues to be the most widely used and respected supervision text in the field.

Like Stonehenge, they are both a monument to our pre-history and a cryptic puzzle. We know that in Chaco Canyon, one thousand years ago, there arose among the Pueblo people a great and culturally sophisticated civilization.

First published in 1986 and now updated with the latest archaeological and anthropological evidence, <em>People of Chaco</em> is an essential book for the general reader on the Chaco culture and ruins.

John Barrell&#39;s influential 1980 study shows why the poor began to be of such interest to painters, and examines the ways in which they could be represented so as to be an acceptable part of the d�cor of the salons of the rich. His discussion focuses on the work of three painters: Thomas Gainsborough, George Morland and John Constable. Throughout the book, Barrell draws illuminating comparisons with the literature of rural life and with the work of other painters. His terse and vigourous account has provided a landmark for social historians and literary critics, as well as historians of art.</p><p>A vigorously written account of the changes in the depiction of the rural poor in English landscape painting between 1730 and 1840.'This is a most original, searching and disquieting book.

Lienhard's radio program "The Engines of Our Ingenuity." In this fascinating book, Lienhard gathers his reflections on the nature of technology, culture, and human inventiveness. The book brims with insightful observations. Lienhard writes that the history of technology is a history of us--we are the machines we create. Thus farming dramatically changed the rhythms of human life and redirected history. War seldom fuels invention--radar, jets, and the digital computer all emerged before World War II began. And the medieval Church was a driving force behind the growth of Western technology--Cistercian monasteries were virtual factories, whose water wheels cut wood, forged iron, and crushed olives. Lienhard illustrates his themes through inventors, mathematicians, and engineers--with stories of the canoe, the DC-3, the Hoover Dam, the diode, and the sewing machine. We gain new insight as to who we are, through the familiar machines and technologies that are central to our lives.<br></p><p>Technology is not just a byword to refer to the sum of designs and applications that enable us to do things like open cans--or make cans in the first place. It is, writes engineer John Lienhard in this imaginative survey, an instrument by which we become more human, a means of interacting with and learning from the world. Technology mirrors humans, and humans mirror technology, and the question that remains is "whether we are to be lifted up or dragged down in the process."<p> Although he is quick to acknowledge the harmful applications of technology over the years, especially in producing ever more novel and efficient ways of killing each other, Lienhard is inclined to point toward the beneficial uses of machines and tools and the innate beauty of a thing well made. (Not for nothing, he notes, did Henry David Thoreau proudly carry a calling card that identified him as a civil engineer.) As he ranges throughout history, Lienhard offers wonderful case studies of well-intentioned attempts to make the best uses of technology--Christopher Wren's construction of St. Paul's Cathedral in London, the colonial American oddball John Fitch's invention of the first paddlewheel steamer, Mark Twain's financing of a revolutionary and doomed typesetting machine--and to change the world in the bargain. Lienhard's pages are populated with characters who have been largely forgotten in the standard history books, but whose work added greatly to the quality of life of succeeding generations. His book deserves a place on the shelf alongside Kenneth Clark's <i>Civilization</i> and Jacob Bronowski's <i>Ascent of Man</i> as a spirited celebration of the practical imagination. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br><strong>John Lienhard</strong> is the M.D. Anderson Professor Emeritus of Mechanical Engineering and History at the University of Houston.

A merry Christmas, everyone!</p></p><p>In the history of English literature, Charles Dickens's <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, which has been continuously in print since it was first published in the winter of 1843, stands out as the quintessential Christmas story. What makes this charming edition of Dickens's immortal tale so special is the collection of 80 vivid illustrations by Everett Shinn (1876-1953). Shinn, a well-known artist in his time, was a popular illustrator of newspapers and magazines whose work displayed a remarkable affinity for the stories of Charles Dickens, evoking the bustling street life of the mid-1800s. Printed on heavy, cream-colored paper stock, the edges of the pages have been left rough, simulating the way in which the story might have appeared in Dickens's own time. Though countless editions of this classic have been published over the years, this one stands out as particularly beautiful, nostalgic, and evocative of the spirit of Christmas.<p>Traditional cover with this full-color gift edition in a slipcase.</p></p><h2>The Quantum Theory of Fields, Vol. 2: Modern Applications</h2><p>In this second volume of The Quantum Theory of Fields, available for the first time in paperback, Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg continues his masterly expoistion of quantum theory.

He demonstrates that high levels of cooperation are found where people have to band together to fight off a common enemy, and that this kind of cooperation led to the formation of the Roman and Russian empires, and the United States. But as empires grow, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer, conflict replaces cooperation, and dissolution inevitably follows. Eloquently argued and rich with historical examples, <i>War and Peace and War</i> offers a bold new theory about the course of world history.<br><br></p></p><p>Introduction<p><b>Introduction</b></p><p><b><i>"So Peace Brings Warre and Warre Brings Peace"</i></b></p><p>The empire has unified all the civilizations at last. After generations of battles, the last enemies have been defeated. Citizens of the empire can, it seems, look forward to permanent peace and prosperity. But a maverick mathematician named Hari Seldon has disturbing news. His new science of psychohistory, built from equations that integrate the actions of myriads of individuals, predicts large-scale social trends. When the equations are run forward, they foretell the decay and eventual collapse of the central power, rebellions by regional barons and rogue generals, and finally a bitter civil war that will transform the capital of the empire from a teeming metropolis of hundreds of billions into a ghost town with a few thousand survivors eking out a miserable living among the ruins. The decline and fall of the empire over the ensuing centuries unfolds precisely as the humble mathematician said it would.</p><p>This scenario from the <i>Foundation</i> trilogy of Isaac Asimov occurs in the future on the planet Trantor, the capital of a mighty galactic empire. In Asimov's fantasy, human history can be understood and predicted in the same way that physicists understand and predict the trajectories of planets, or biologists the expression of the gene. The key to the prediction of human societies is psychohistory, the "branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli." The ability of psychohistorians to make accurate forecasts, however, is not absolute. Psychohistory cannot accurately predict actions of a single individual. Furthermore, the knowledge of the prediction must be withheld from the people whose collective behavior is predicted. As Hari Seldon explains, "By knowledge, your freedom of action would be expanded and the number of additional variables introduced would become greater than our psychology could handle." Prediction of human societies might also prove impossible for another reason: Complex dynamic systems are inherently unpredictable in the long run because of "the butterfly effect." Small causes might produce large effects. For example, a butterfly fluttering its wings in Australia might cause a hurricane in the Atlantic. Or, as a children's rhyme has it, "For want of a nail... the kingdom was lost." Asimov, however, could not know about the butterfly effect because he wrote the trilogy in the early 1950s, before the discovery of mathematical chaos.</p><p>Asimov's trilogy captured the imagination of millions of readers, among them quite a few scientists and historians. However, his vision flies in the face of the view held by most professional historians and scientists, a view generally accepted in our culture. For centuries, philosophers have mulled over the prospects of a scientific study of history. Despite some dissenting voices, the consensus has been that scientific study of human societies is impossible because they differ too much from physical and biological systems. They are too complex. They consist not of simple identical particles, such as atoms and molecules, but of human individuals, each unique, endowed with free will, and capable of purposeful action. The verdict has been that any sort of scientific history must remain science fiction rather than a real science. And some might believe that this is for the best. </p><p>A science of history sounds cold and hard&#x2014;wouldn't it destroy our enjoyment of the wonderfully rich tapestry of the past? On a darker side, might not such a science enable some shadowy cabal to manipulate societies to a nefarious purpose? But have we ceased to enjoy the blue sky of a brilliant summer day, or the play of colors in a glorious sunset? After all, the physicists, beginning with Newton and ending with Einstein, worked out exactly how colors of the sky result from the interaction of sunlight with the atmosphere. As to the nefarious uses of a science of history, it is true that any knowledge can be turned to good or bad ends. But Asimov's notion of a Second Foundation&#x2014;a group of psychohistorians pulling the strings from some secret center&#x2014;was always the least credible part of his vision.</p><p><i>War and Peace and War</i> addresses the question raised by Asimov (and many other people before him, including Marx and Tolstoy): Is a science of history possible? Can we design a theory for the collapse of mighty empires that would be no worse than, say, our understanding of why earthquakes happen? Seismologists have made great strides in understanding earthquakes. They can even make some limited predictions as to which areas of the earth are likely to be hit next by an earthquake. However, forecasting the precise timing and magnitude of an earthquake eludes them. Can a science of history, similarly, explain why states crumble, and perhaps predict which societies are in the danger of collapse?</p><p><b>This book focuses on empires.</b> Why did some&#x2014;initially small and insignificant&#x2014;nations go on to build mighty empires, whereas other nations failed to do so? And why do the successful empire builders invariably, given enough time, lose their empires? Can we understand how imperial powers rise and why they fall?</p><p>An empire is a large, multiethnic territorial state with a complex power structure. The key variable is the size. When large enough, states invariably encompass ethnically diverse people; this makes them into multiethnic states. And given the difficulties of communication in pre-industrial times, large states had to come up with a variety of ad hoc ways to bind far-flung territories to the center. One of the typical expedients was to incorporate smaller neighbors as self-contained units, imposing tribute on them and taking over their foreign relations, but otherwise leaving their internal functioning alone. Such a process of piecemeal accumulation usually leads to complicated chains of command and the coexistence of heterogeneous territories within one state.</p><p>Empires are not the only objects of study for a science of history. Historians such as Arnold Toynbee wrote volumes on the rise and fall of whole civilizations. Others have been fascinated with the spread of world religions, evolution of art styles, progress in science and technology, or economic and demographic changes. All of these subjects are worthy. However, it is impossible to encompass them all in one book. The rise and fall of empires is a fine place to start.</p><p>Unlike such entities as civilizations, territorial states are easier to define and demarcate from each other, as well as from other comparable units (city states, tribal confederations, and so on). Historians continue to argue about how to distinguish one civilization from another. Different authorities place Achaemenid Persia as part of the Syriac, Iranian, or Mesopotamian civilization. In contrast to this multitude of contending notions, were you to consult any historical atlas, you would find the boundaries of the Achaemenid Empire drawn in pretty much the same places. </p><p>Although the doings of empires dominate the historical records, we should not conclude that they are the norm in human history. Prior to the nineteenth century most (and until six thousand years ago all) of the habitable space on Earth was divided among small-scale, stateless societies, not empires. Historical empires themselves, as often as not, were in the state of decline or even disintegration. A large stable empire, internally at peace, is a rarity in history. Looked at from this point of view, the most fundamental question requiring an explanation is not why empires decline and collapse, but how they manage to get going in the first place. How are empires possible?</p><p>The stories of empire are irresistible. Imagine the feelings of an eighteenth-century Englishman, on his world tour, standing among the fairly well-preserved 2,000-year-old ruins of ancient Rome (before the modern metropolis engulfed them). Today one can have a similar experience in Chichen Itza in Mexico. (Be sure to get there early in the day before the tourist buses arrive.) Who were the people who built these magnificent temples and pyramids? Why aren't they around anymore? From Shelley's "Ozymandias" to Darth Vader, stories of empires fascinate us.</p><p><b>As a road map to what </b>follows, here is a very terse outline of the central theoretical argument of the book.</p><p>Many historical processes are dynamic&#x2014;empires rise and fall, populations and economies boom and bust, world religions spread or wither. The field of historical dynamics investigates such dynamic processes in history. Most research has been done on agrarian societies, those in which the majority (and often more than 90 percent) of people are involved in producing food.</p><p>The theoretical framework I have been developing for several years focuses not on human individuals, but on social groups through time. Ultimately, the behavior of a group is determined by the actions of its individual members. However, social groups are not simple collections of identical particles, readily described by statistical physics; they have complex internal structures.</p><p>One important aspect of group structure is that different people have access to differing amounts of power and wealth. A small number of members of an agrarian society (typically around 1 or 2 percent) concentrates in its hands most of the power and wealth; this group consists of the elites or aristocracy. Commoners make up the rest of the population.</p><p>Another important aspect of social structure is ethnicity. Ethnicity is the group use of any aspect of culture to create internal cohesion and differentiation from other groups. An imaginary boundary separates the members of the ethnic group from the rest of humanity. For example, Greeks drew a boundary between themselves and barbarians, non-Greek speakers. The ethnic boundary can use a variety of <i>symbolic m...</i></p>Ranging freely from the founding of Rome to 17th-century North America, this provocative essay in "cliodynamics" ("the study of processes that change with time") searches for scientific regularities that underlie history. Ecologist and mathematician Turchin grounds his theory of preindustrial empires in the Arabic concept of <i>asabiya,</i> meaning a society's capacity for collective action. Empires germinate, he contends, along "meta-ethnic frontiers" where conflict between starkly alien peoples&#x2014;Roman farmers vs. Celtic tribesmen in the fifth and sixth centuries B.C., say&#x2014;fosters the social solidarity and discipline that empire building requires. Success, he continues, leads inexorably to decline: stability and prosperity produce overpopulation and a Malthusian crisis in which the struggle for scarce resources undermines social solidarity and triggers imperial collapse. Turchin's straining for scientific exactitude occasionally overreaches, yielding a proliferation of historical "cycles" of fuzzy periodicity, riddled with fudge factors like "mathematical chaos." Still, Turchin's focus on social cooperation as the key to history is a fruitful one, and his ideas generate many fascinating discussions of a wide variety of historical episodes, rendered in lucid, vigorous prose. The result, much in the vein of Jared Diamond's <i>Guns, Germs and Steel</i>, is a stimulating revisionist overview of world history.

It sets the stage for an array of case-study volumes, each of which focuses on a single area of the world. Each case study uses the contemporary musical situation as a point of departure, covering historical information and traditions as they relate to the present. Visit www.oup.com/us/globalmusic for a list of case studies in the Global Music Series. The website also includes instructional materials to accompany each study. <br> This unique volume provides an accessible introduction to the social, cultural, and economic conditions surrounding mariachi music in the United States. Large immigrations of Mexicans to the U.S., the power of the international recording industry, and the fluid travel of mariachi musicians between the two countries have resulted in a strong base of musical continuity across the political border. Drawing on thirty-five years of personal performance experience and on interviews with leading mariachi musicians, author Daniel Sheehy offers first-hand perspectives on the music's stylistic cornerstones, aesthetic standards, social standing, and economic life. He explains how mariachi music is simultaneously a folk music rooted in more than 150 years of tradition, a commodity governed by market considerations, and a dynamic course of activity that has been shaped and expanded by musical innovation and social meaning. The book focuses on the rising popularity of mariachi music amongst Mexican Americans--over the last twenty-five years, numerous mariachi festivals have become annual events in the U.S., a multitude of workshops and school programs have been developed, and more women have become involved in public mariachi performances. <em>Mariachi Music in America</em> is a captivating study that will interest students, aspiring performers, teachers, and aficionados alike. <br> Enhanced by vivid photos and illustrations and first-hand accounts of musicians, organizers, and audiences, <em>Mariachi Music in America</em> is packaged with a 50-minute CD containing examples of the music discussed in the book. It also features guided listening and hands-on activities that encourage readers to engage actively and critically with the music.<br></p><p><br><strong>Daniel Sheehy</strong> served as Director of Folk &amp; Traditional Arts at the National Endowment for the Arts from 1992-2000 and as staff ethnomusicologist and Assistant Director from 1978-1992.

Everest: Sherpas and Himalayan Mountaineering</h2><p><p>The Sherpas were dead, two more victims of an attempt to scale Mt. Everest. Members of a French climbing expedition, sensitive perhaps about leaving the bodies where they could not be recovered, rolled them off a steep mountain face. One body, however, crashed to a stop near Sherpas on a separate expedition far below. They stared at the frozen corpse, stunned. They said nothing, but an American climber observing the scene interpreted their thoughts: Nobody would throw the body of a white climber off Mt. Everest.</p><br><p> For more than a century, climbers from around the world have journ-eyed to test themselves on Everest's treacherous slopes, enlisting the expert aid of the Sherpas who live in the area. Drawing on years of field research in the Himalayas, renowned anthropologist Sherry Ortner presents a compelling account of the evolving relationship between the mountaineers and the Sherpas, a relationship of mutual dependence and cultural conflict played out in an environment of mortal risk.</p><br><p> Ortner explores this relationship partly through gripping accounts of expeditions--often in the climbers' own words--ranging from nineteenth-century forays by the British through the historic ascent of Hillary and Tenzing to the disasters described in Jon Krakauer's <i>Into Thin Air.</i> She reveals the climbers, or "sahibs," to use the Sherpas' phrase, as countercultural romantics, seeking to transcend the vulgarity and materialism of modernity through the rigor and beauty of mountaineering. She shows how climbers' behavior toward the Sherpas has ranged from kindness to cruelty, from cultural sensitivity to derision. Ortner traces the political and economic factors that led the Sherpas to join expeditions and examines the impact of climbing on their traditional culture, religion, and identity. She examines Sherpas' attitude toward death, the implications of the shared masculinity of Sherpas and sahibs, and the relationship between Sherpas and the increasing number of women climbers. Ortner also tackles debates about whether the Sherpas have been "spoiled" by mountaineering and whether climbing itself has been spoiled by commercialism.</p></p><p><p>"Sherry Ortner's <i>Life and Death on Mt. Everest</i> is a stunning book: it is a probing ethnography of the strange, unequal relationship between 'sahibs' and Sherpas, a suggestive social history of the contemporary leisure class, and a powerful, often painful meditation on the cult and culture of high-risk mountaineering. With a humane, ironic, steady, and compassionate gaze, Ortner looks at lives lived at the edge of an abyss."<b>--Stephen Greenblatt</b></p><p>"Sherry <i>Ortner's Life and Death on Mt.

Born in 1899, Crane became one of the most significant modernist American poets, yet his self-destructive tendencies - violent outbursts, massive drinking binges, and dangerous sexual pursuits - came to a catastrophic conclusion when at only thirty-two he threw himself from the stern of an ocean liner into the Gulf of Mexico. This new biography presents a full, frank portrait of the real Hart Crane, a poet attractive both for his flamboyance and passion for life, and for the magnificent sonorities of his work.</p><p>Clive Fisher is a critic whose writings have appeared in numerous publications including the Times (London), Financial Times, and Punch. He is the author of Noel Coward and Cyril Connolly: A Nostalgic Life.Elusive, cryptic, and often bewildering, Harold Hart Crane's poetry demands more than a token effort to comprehend; readers should expect to make a similar investment when trying to understand the man himself. Crane (1899-1932) announced at age 11 that he was going to be a poet, not necessarily good news to his battling, soon-to-be-divorced parents. Feeling abandoned and alone, the psychosomatic Crane attempted suicide as a teenager. In New York, he began a lifelong pattern: writing poetry, living in rented rooms, drinking, developing male friendships (almost exclusively heterosexual), and seeking out homosexual encounters (especially with sailors, which connected him to his great love, the sea). Some of his poetry reflects these encounters in oblique terms, nonetheless revealing loss and regret. Increasingly tortured by drink, Crane managed to maintain a generosity of spirit and a childlike faith in certain ideals of life. There were times when he could not write, but his imagination was never stilled. Crane wandered from New York to London to Paris to Mexico, never finding a resting place until he threw himself from a moving ship into the deadly waters of the Gulf of Mexico. What remains is his poetry. Fisher, author of Noel Coward and Cyril Connolly: A Nostalgic Life, rewards the reader with an exacting book that makes knowing Hart Crane a vivid possibility.

Whether rummaging through the detritus and icons of the estates to be sold, dealing with customers, handling the gavel or vying for business, Woolley offers a wry view of the world of money, values, art and collecting. An expert in valuing Russian art, having been trained at the Fifth Avenue shop of A La Vieille Russie in Manhattan, he recounts his adventures here and abroad in acquiring, pricing and selling it. He muses on Andy Warhol's astonishing shopping habits and puzzling acquisitions, and the postmortem hunting and sorting of things stowed in paper bags, drawers or, as with valuable jewelry, tossed on top of Warhol's bed; and he marvels at the prices he enjoyed getting for them. He romps through Liberace's kitsch and discusses fashions in the art market, and why the Japanese have paid such exorbitant prices. His personal life is wide open: he enjoys being a "walker" for wealthy women, and he speaks frankly about the network of homosexuals in the art business, his own gay life and lovers, his AIDS infection and his charitable work for other victims who "do not have the luxury of dying in the style to which I am accustomed." <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Principles of Corporate Finance (Finance, Insurance, and Real Estate)</h2><p><i>Principles of Corporate Finance </i>is the worldwide leading text that describes the theory and practice of corporate finance.

Banished by her beautiful, indolent mother to England, Barbary Deniston is thrown into the care of her distinguished father and conventional stepmother. Having grown up in the sunshine of Provence, allowed to run wild with the Maquis, experienced collaboration, betrayal and death, Barbary finds it hard to adjust to the drab austerity of postwar London life.</p><p>Confused and unhappy, she discovers one day the flowering wastes around St Paul's. Here, in the bombed heart of London, she finds an echo of the wilderness of Provence and is forced to confront the wilderness within herself.</p></p><p>Rose Macaulay (1881-1958) was born in Rugby, Warwickshire. She studied Modern History at Somerville College, Oxford and wrote her first novel, <i>Abbots Verney </i>in 1906. She was introduced to the London literary scene by her childhood friend Rupert Brooke, and her friends included Ivy Compton-Burnett, Virginia Woolf, E. M. Forster, Rosamond Lehmann and Elizabeth Bowen. Macaulay became celebrated writer who published over thirty works of fiction, non-fiction and poetry in her lifetime, including <i>Crewe Train </i>and <i>The World My Wilderness</i>. She won the James Tait Black Memorial prize for her final novel, <i>The Towers of Trebizond</i> (1956) and was awarded the DBE in 1957.<i>The World My Wilderness</i> ... had a powerful effect on me as a young reader, growing up in postwar London.

A Hicks piece may deploy traditional fibers like cotton, wool and silk alongside, for example, porcupine quills, feathers or steel fibers; equally unexpected is the often monumental scale of her works, which frequently respond to the architecture surrounding them.</p><p>An American who has lived and worked in Paris since 1964, Hicks has traveled through five continents, visiting Mexico, France, Morocco, India, Chile, Sweden, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Japan and South Africa, to develop relationships with designers, artisans, industrialists, architects, politicians and cultural leaders in the creation of these fabulous and unique works that blur boundaries between craft and art in ways that now seem prescient of today&#x2019;s broader demolition of such hierarchies.</p><p>All facets of the artist&#x2019;s extraordinary six-decade career are surveyed in this catalog, published for her exhibition at the Centre Pompidou in Paris.

Authors Carol and Eric Meyers are perhaps uniquely qualified for this work because of their backgrounds in biblical archaeology and the social sciences. Employing the highest standards of pilological, literary, and historical research, they shed light on many enigmatic passages and offer an entirely new perspective on the history of Israel and its religion in the Persian period.<br><br>Whereas many scholars have viewed this point in the history of Israel as a time of deterioration of the beliefs and practices of biblical religion, the Meyerses paint a picture of an innovative and vibrant community struggling to maintain its identity within a rapidly changing world dominated by the mighty Greeks and Persians. In the face of this the author of Zechariah 9-14 makes extensive and transformative use of earlier biblical writings and of the sayings of previous prophets, and articulates a radically new view of Israel's future.<br><br>The Meyerses are the first modern commentators to see in these ancient texts the central role played by the Greco-Persian Wars in shaping the postexilic Restoration Community of Israel and its views of an expansive and glorious future. And althought Zechariah 9-14 is often regarded as the swan song of biblical prophecy, the Meyerses clearly demonstrate that the new modes of prophetic discourse found within this text helped biblical religion to meet one of the greatest challenges in its long history.</p><p><b>Eric M. Meyers</b> and <b>Carol L. Meyers</b> are husband-and-wife team of biblical scholars and archaeologists from Duke University in Durham, North Carolina. They have codirected an archaeological project for many years and have collaborated on other publications, including the Anchor Bible volume 25B, Haggai, Zechariah 1-8.

Tracing capitalism from its beginning to the present day, Dan Cryan and Sharron Shatil, alongside Piero&#39;s brilliant graphics, look at its practical and theoretical impact. They cover the major economic, social and political developments that shaped the world we live in, such as the rise of banking, the founding of America and the Opium Wars.This book explores the leading views for and against, including thinkers like Adam Smith, Karl Marx, Theodor Adorno and Milton Friedman, together with the connections between them and their historical context. Capitalism has influenced everything in the 21st-century world. For anyone who wants to gain a broad understanding of this fascinating subject, this book cuts across narrow academic lines to analyse an all-encompassing feature of modern life.</p><p>Dan Cryan has degrees in Philosophy from UCL and now works as a market analyst in London. Sharron Shatil is a Philosophy lecturer at the Open Universityin Israel.

The book is a carefully organized, powerful evocation of place and of a young man's quest for identity.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe. Each affordable volume reflects Oxford's commitment to scholarship, providing the most accurate text plus a wealth of other valuable features, including expert introductions by leading authorities, voluminous notes to clarify the text, up-to-date bibliographies for further study, and much more.<br></p><p>One of the particular pleasures of reading <i>Kim</i> is the full range of emotion, knowledge, and experience that Rudyard Kipling gives his complex hero. Kim O'Hara, the orphaned son of an Irish soldier stationed in India, is neither innocent nor victimized. Raised by an opium-addicted half-caste woman since his equally dissolute father's death, the boy has grown up in the streets of Lahore: <blockquote> Though he was burned black as any native; though he spoke the vernacular by preference, and his mother-tongue in a clipped uncertain sing-song; though he consorted on terms of perfect equality with the small boys of the bazar; Kim was white--a poor white of the very poorest. </blockquote> From his father and the woman who raised him, Kim has come to believe that a great destiny awaits him. The details, however, are a bit fuzzy, consisting as they do of the woman's addled prophecies of "'a great Red Bull on a green field, and the Colonel riding on his tall horse, yes, and'--dropping into English--'nine hundred devils.'" <p> In the meantime, Kim amuses himself with intrigues, executing "commissions by night on the crowded housetops for sleek and shiny young men of fashion." His peculiar heritage as a white child gone native, combined with his "love of the game for its own sake," makes him uniquely suited for a bigger game. And when, at last, the long-awaited colonel comes along, Kim is recruited as a spy in Britain's struggle to maintain its colonial grip on India. Kipling was, first and foremost, a man of his time; born and raised in India in the 19th century, he was a fervid supporter of the Raj. Nevertheless, his portrait of India and its people is remarkably sympathetic. Yes, there is the stereotypical Westernized Indian Babu Huree Chander with his atrocious English, but there is also Kim's friend and mentor, the Afghani horse trader Mahub Ali, and the gentle Tibetan lama with whom Kim travels along the Grand Trunk Road. The humanity of his characters consistently belies Kipling's private prejudices, and raises <i>Kim</i> above the mere ripping good yarn to the level of a timeless classic. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Kim is an orphan, living from hand to mouth in the teeming streets of Lahore. One day he meets a man quite unlike anything in his wide experience, a Tibetan lama on a quest. Kim's life suddenly acquires meaning and purpose as he becomes the lama's guide and protector--his chela. Other forces are at work as Kim is sucked into the intrigue of the Great Game and travels the Grand Trunk Road with his lama.<p></p><p>How Kim and the lama meet their respective destinies on the road and in the mountains of India forms one of the most compelling adventure tales of all time.</p></p><h2>Principles of Interpretation</h2><p>A systematic introduction to interpretation as a technical therapeutic skill.</p><p><b>Steven T. Levy</b>, M.D., is Bernard C. Holland Professor and chief of psychiatry at Emory University School of Medicine at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia.The writing is clear, concise, and confident. The book's tone and content effectively make the author's point that psychotherapy is a powerful instrument which requires self-discipline, knowledge, no mean intellectual effort, and considerable technical skill, in addition to the therapist's sympathetic and considerate attitude. Beginning therapists will feel constructively challenged by this message and by the author's criticism of experiential and humanistic approaches for their antitechnical and antitheoretical biases. The book's organization broadly follows the phases of therapy with systematic discussions of the data to be understood, transference, resistance, countertransference, the therapeutic alliance, and special problems. A concluding chapter discusses general principles of interpretation, working through, and timing. A valuable feature is the author's annotated list of suggested readings at the end of each chapter. (John Pareja <i>Psychoanalytic Quarterly</i>)<br><br>The book's greatest strength is the author's concept of the role of interpretation in the therapeutic process. He demonstrates his thinking at the level of clinical theory, both in providing generalizations and in supporting them with unusually apt clinical vignettes. Most impressive is the author's empathy and sensitivity, both to patients and to beginning therapists, conveyed repeatedly in matters of tone and style, humane without being weak or watered down. (Sanford Weisblatt <i>Contemporary Psychiatry</i>)<br><br>[A] small gem. . . . It is accessible, short, well-written, and entirely relevant for someone who wants to learn what to say, and how to say it, in psychoanalytic psychotherapy.

Written for both casual and serious birders, the book features detailed site guides to the entire coastal region, including the Outer Banks. John Fussell provides an annotated checklist, habitat information, and bar graphs indicating seasonal abundance for all regularly occurring species. The book also includes a chapter on the 140 most sought-after species on the coast. Fussell describes the best places and conditions--seasonal, weather, and tidal--for finding these popular varieties.

It caused considerable controversy for its bold refutation of earlier accounts of the war, but its brilliant analysis and balanced tone left critics floundering, changed the course of U.S. military history by renewing interest in our obsolete forces, and set the young author and political hopeful on a path to greatness. Roosevelt's inimitable style and robust narrative make The Naval War of 1812 enthralling, illuminating, and utterly essential to every armchair historian. <br> The books in the Modern Library War series have been chosen by series editor Caleb Carr according to the significance of their subject matter, their contribution to the field of military history, and their literary merit.In addition to his political accomplishments, Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), the twenty-sixth president of the United States, is known for his achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter, soldier, and author.</p><h2>Management Rights: A Legal and Arbitral Analysis (Arbitration Series)</h2><p>This text in substantial part, relies on arbitration Awards published by the Bureau of national Affairs Incorporated BNA &amp; or by Commerce Clearinghouse CCH. To the extent that these awards are not representative of the thinking of the arbitral community, the conclusions drawn by the authors maybe suspect. An analysis by Stieber, Block &amp; Corbett of 759 discharge cases published in Labor Arbitration Reports BNA &amp; or in labor arbitration Awards CCH in 1979, 1980, &amp; 1981 revealed that in both publication the final outcomes &amp; awards for representative of final out comes &amp; Awards in unpublished cases at least when judged by the results in a collection of unpublished cases decided by Michigan arbitrators. To the extent that the constituencies, practices, &amp; local statutory restrictions for Michigan arbitrators differ from those arbitrators Nationwide, the findings are, of course, not reliable. The study also indicated that in terms of actual proportion of types of cases to the whole, published decisions tend to underrepresent public sector cases, cases involving female grievance, &amp; cases involving employees in the service occupations. Cases published by BNA showed a significant higher grievance denial rate than the rate of the Michigan "control" group, while case was published by CCH showed an even more significant lower denial rate than that for unpublished decisions. However the combined grievance denial rate in cases published by BNA &amp; CCH was found to be quite representative of the overall denial rate for the unpublished cases. As pointed out by Stieber &amp; his colleague, this suggest that if one wishes to draw conclusion from published cases, both cases published by BNA &amp; cases published by CCH should be examined. The authors have done this.</p><p></p><h2>Jane Eyre (Classic Lines)</h2><p>Fiery passion, shocking secrets, and a compelling, vulnerable heroine in peril have made <i>Jane Eyre</i> an enduring favorite. When Jane becomes governess at gloomy Thornfield Hall, she falls deeply in love with the brooding, tormented Edward Rochester--and he with her. But soon Jane realizes that the house holds terrifying mysteries. What is Rochester hiding from Jane? Will their smoldering relationship survive--or will Jane be left heartbroken and exiled?</p><p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms. It will include novels, poetry, short stories, essays, travel-writing and other non-fiction.Charlotte Bronte's impassioned novel is the love story of Jane Eyre, a plain yet spirited governess, and her arrogant, brooding Mr. Rochester. Published in 1847, under the pseudonym of Currer Bell, the book heralded a new kind of heroine--one whose virtuous integrity, keen intellect and tireless perseverance broke through class barriers to win equal stature with the man she loved. Hailed by William Makepeace Thackeray as "the masterwork of great genius," <i>Jane Eyre</i> is still regarded, over a century later, as one of the finest novels in English literature.</p><h2>The Organic Machine: The Remaking of the Columbia River</h2><p>Describes how humans have changed the Columbia River, and discusses the way people interact with nature through work</p><p>In The Organic Machine, Richard White, a distinguished historian and leading scholar of the American West, explores the intimate relationship between nature and mankind along the Columbia River. Working on the cutting edge of environmental and social history, White demonstrates how, over the centuries, both native peoples and settlers have continually remade the river, treating it as a machine designed to churn out energy and sustenance. He assesses the impact on the Northwest ecology of enterprises that have marked the river&#39;s history, from salmon fishing to the Hanford Energy Works nuclear plant, and eloquently reveals the insights and illusions of those who work with the river.Richard White is professor of history at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p><h2>Essential Techniques of Landscape Drawing: Master the Concepts and Methods for Observing and Rendering Nature</h2><p><b><b>This beginner's guide to drawing in graphite pencil uses step-by-step exercises to teach fundamental methods for rendering all aspects of the natural landscape, with additional lessons on using charcoal, colored pencil, pastel, and other media.</b></b><br><br>Following in the footsteps of author, artist, and art instructor Suzanne Brooker's previous title <i>The Elements of Landscape Oil Painting</i>, this book pairs the most universally-pursued topic for artists (drawing) with the popular subject matter of the natural landscape. Brooker breaks down landscapes into their various elements--including the earth, water, air, and trees--to convey how the fundamentals of drawing are applied to capture each aspect. Using the graphite pencil as her baseline instrument, Brooker provides you with step-by-step lessons that help you improve your rendering skills and re-create the beauty of the world outdoors. Examples from art history and contemporary masters supplement these lessons. The end result is a drawing instruction book that provides artists with everything they need to render landscapes no matter their skill level.</p><p>SUZANNE BROOKER has dedicated her life to art-making, both in studio practice and as an educator. She began her career as a teaching artist after receiving her MFA in figurative painting from California State University, Long Beach. She first began teaching at the Gage Academy of Art in Seattle in 1999. Since 2013, she has focused her classes on landscape painting and drawing. She is the author of<i> Portrait Painting Atelier</i> and <i>The Elements of Landscape Oil Painting</i>.Chapter 1: The Basics of Landscape Drawing&nbsp;<br><br>WHAT IS VISUAL THINKING?<br> <i><br>Visual thinking </i>is a different, non-verbal mode of thinking as compared to those used for analyzing, reasoning or communicating with language. It is based on a visual language of line, shape, color, value, and texture&#x2014;the formal elements that create all visual images. You can think of visual thinking as if it were a new alphabet, one made up of pencil marks that when assembled make up grass, clouds, and water, instead of words, sentences, and thoughts. Essentially, all drawings are made up of abstract marks organized via visual thinking to convey a sense of representation or realness for the viewer. After all, paper is flat but the world is filled with dimension. As a result, you can think of a drawn image as the art of illusion, of creating the resemblance of volume and space.<br><br>Developing our observational skills becomes important since what we draw is our <i>perceptions </i>of the natural world. The process of drawing opens your perceptions of the visible world through an active process of observation where <i>what </i>your eyes see-by-looking is melded to the mental function of <i>noticing</i>. Learning to draw is not only about seeing in a new way, but also translating what you see through drawing techniques and the visual traditions of Western culture. In the following chapters, you&#x2019;ll learn more about specific techniques and how these skills are applied in landscape drawing.<br><br>The importance of drawing can never be overstated. Through drawing, you activate a connection between your eyes and your brain through to your hand that reflects your thoughts and perceptions revealed through drawing materials. In other words, visual thinking is the way you perceive the world around you and convert those observations via the drawing process.<br><br>Drawing as a finished product doesn&#x2019;t even matter as much as the process of drawing itself does. One of the benefits of learning to draw is that it enhances your mental functions, literally building new connections within your brain. Although we consider communicating with language as the most important brain function, it is vision that dominates our senses. Drawing utilizes the right side of your brain, which perceives spatial relationships, patterns and shape relationships. Unlike the left side of your brain, it has no words/language as it perceives the world visually. For instance, without the right side of your brain you wouldn&#x2019;t be able to drive or walk down a simple stairway! The left side of your brain however, is verbal and functions visually by symbol recognition. It gives verbal labels for what you see (grass, dog, tree) and stops noticing once an object is identified. A drawing practice focuses your mental attention on the present moment and quiets the verbal chatter of your left brain so you can see/notice what the right brain is observing. This opens your awareness of the natural world away from the concerns of daily life.<br><br>***</p><h2>Kings and Philosophers, 1689-1789 (The Norton History of Modern Europe)</h2><p><p><strong>The one hundred years that preceded the French Revolution witnessed the rise of kings to unmatched power and influence in European affairs.</strong></p> These years also encompassed the birth, maturation, and waning of the Enlightenment.

I found myself wanting to practice in the field as well as to become a university professor and researcher. I pursued both professional desires starting with employment at Cameron and Colby (a reinsurance company) in Boston and General Electric&#x2019;s Aerospace business group in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania.</p> <p> <br> </p> <p>I advanced my education in the human resource management (HRM) field by earning a master&#x2019;s degree and PhD degree at Michigan State University. My master&#x2019;s degree enabled me to build an even stronger foundation in practice and my doctoral degree provided me with the skills to conduct scholarly research and teach college-level courses. Since earning my graduate degrees, I have been a professor in the School of Labor and Employment Relations at the University of Illinois, Urbana, Champaign and assumed administrative roles as a Provost Fellow, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, and Interim Dean. All the while, I have taught a variety of courses in the HRM field. These include compensation systems, employee benefits, employment systems (HRM and labor relations), HR planning and staffing, and statistics.

Revisiting historical icons so familiar that schoolchildren learn to take them for granted, he makes surprising connections that enable readers to see old stories in a new light.<br><br>Among the historical moments revisited here, a revolutionary nation arises from its environment and struggles to reconcile the diversity of its people with the claim that nature is the source of liberty.

"Savagery, style, sophistication, sleuthing and sex," said Ellery Queen. Often a desperate blond, a jealous husband, and, of course, a tough-but-tender P.I. the likes of Sam Spade or Philop Marlowe. Perhaps Raymond Chandler summed it up best in his description of Dashiell Hammett's style: "Hammett gave murder back to the kind of people that commit it....He put these people down on paper as they were, and he made them talk and think in the language they customarily used for these purposes."<br> <br> <em>Hard-Boiled: An Anthology of American Crime Stories</em> is the largest and most comprehensive collection of its kind, with over half of the stories never published before in book form. Included are thirty-six sublimely suspenseful stories that chronicle the evolutiuon of this quintessentially American art form, from its earliest beginnings during the Golden Age of the legendary pulp magazine <em>Black Mask</em> in the 1920s, to the arrival of the tough digest <em>Manhunt</em> in the 1950s, and finally leading up to present-day hard-boiled stories by such writers as James Ellroy. Here are eight decades worth of the best writing about betrayal, murder, and mayhem: from Hammett's 1925 tour de force "The Scorched Face," in which the disappearance of two sisters leads Hammett's never-named detective, the Continental Op, straight into a web of sexual blackmail amidst the West Coast elite, to Ed Gorman's 1992 "The Long Silence After," a gripping and powerful rendezvous involving a middle class insurance executive, a Chicago streetwalker, and a loaded .38. Other delectable contributions include "Brush Fire" by James M. Cain, author of <em>The Postman Always Rings Twice</em>, Raymond Chandler's "I'll Be Waiting," where, for once, the <em>femme fatale</em> is not blond but a redhead, a Ross Macdonald mystery starring Macdonald's most famous creation, the cryptic Lew Archer, and "The Screen Test of Mike Hammer" by the one and only Micky Spillane. The hard-boiled cult has more in common with the legendary lawmen of the Wild West than with the gentleman and lady sleuths of traditional drawing room mysteries, and this direct line of descent is on brilliant display in two of the most subtle and tautly written stories in the collection, Elmore Leonard's "3:10 to Yuma" and John D. MacDonald's "Nor Iron Bars." Other contributors include Evan Hunter (better known as Ed McBain), Jim Thompson, Helen Nielsen, Margaret Maron, Andrew Vachss, Faye Kellerman, and Lawrence Block.<br> <br> Compellingly and compulsively readable, <em>Hard-Boiled: An Anthology of American Crime Stories</em> is a page-turner no mystery lover will want to be without.

In the three-sided struggle for empire, the English and French colonists were locked in heated competition for native allies and religious converts. Axtell sharply contrasts the English efforts to civilize the Indians with the French willingness to accept native lifestyles, and reveals why the struggle for control over the continent became a fascinating contest of cultures between shrewd opponents lasting nearly 150 years.</p><p>James Axtell is at College of William and Mary."The best introduction now available to the problem of cultural conversion in the New World."--The New York Times Book Review<br><br>"Offers an impressive array of insights."--The Historian<br><br>"Axtell is one of the finest practitioners of this history of real persons, and his style makes him one of its most graceful writers."--The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography<br><br>"The most ambitious and sophisticated contribution to early American ethnohistory to date."--Alden T.

Beginning with the achievements of Mahatma Gandhi, and following the legacy of nonviolence through the struggles against Nazism in Europe, racism in America, oppression in China and Latin America, and ethnic conflicts in Africa and Bosnia, Nagler unveils a hidden history. Nonviolence, he proposes, has proven its power against arms and social injustice wherever it has been correctly understood and applied.<br><br>Nagler's approach is not only historical, but also spiritual. He argues, drawing upon the experience of Gandhi and other activists, that the shift to nonviolence begins within the individual, through the reshaping and re-visioning of how one understands the world.

Sanford H. Kadish, Stephen J. Schulhofer, Carol S. Steiker, and new co-author Rachel E. Barkow are nationally recognized scholars. Their cohesive intellectual framework views the law as an instrument of social control, providing an analytical tool with which students can interpret and understand doctrine. <b>Criminal Law and Its Processes: Cases and Materials </b>focuses on developing an understanding of principles and rules applicable to all crimes, rather than the detailed and disjointed elements of any particular crime. Cases-and-notes pedagogy, with excerpted materials, questions, and problems, illuminate the material. Problems enhance students' understanding of the basic principles by testing their applications and interactions in the context of particular offenses.</p><p>The <b>Ninth Edition</b> preserves the continuity with its predecessors and makes little fundamental change in organization or coverage, retaining nearly all the principal teaching cases, with recent cases and illustrations added. The text has been carefully edited throughout to enhance the transparency of the organization and accessibility of the notes and questions. Text has been added that guides students--before and after main cases--to understand what those cases are designed to illustrate. Overall, the book features increased clarity and ease of teaching while preserving the book's challenging and sophisticated content. A completely reorganized and revised chapter on group crime includes more student-friendly treatment of accomplice liability and conspiracy that will facilitate the mastery of basic doctrine while emphasizing important policy questions. A new section on punishing corporations for criminal conduct includes an analysis of deferred prosecution and non-prosecution agreements. The updated theft chapter explores the important modern crimes of honest services fraud and identity theft. New problems also test students' understanding of traditional theft offenses as applied to modern technology and intellectual property. The chapter on rape has been dramatically revised with current examples of debates over force and consent as well as new notes on male rape victims and human trafficking. Revised coverage of the death penalty provides a balanced treatment of the issue, incorporates the latest empirical research, and offers new notes on the potential causes of racial discrimination. An updated chapter on homicide includes a completely new section on felony murder. Also revised is the treatment of proportionality; it includes recent Supreme Court case law under the Eighth Amendment and challenges to life without the possibility of parole sentences. The question of what to punish is now explored through the lens of teenage bullying. Finally, new sentencing materials have been introduced, including a case study of Bernie Madoff's sentencing.</p><p> Features</p><ul><li><b>Highly respected authorship</b><ul> <li>Kadish, Schulhofer, Steiker, and new co-author Barkow are nationally recognized scholars</li></ul></li><li><b>Cohesive intellectual framework</b><ul><li>views the law as an instrument of social control </li><li>provides an analytical tool with which students can interpret and understand doctrine</li><li></li></ul></li> <li><b>Cases-and-notes pedagogy</b><ul><li>includes excerpted materials, questions, and problems</li></ul></li><li>Develops an understanding of <b>principles and rules applicable to all crimes</b><ul><li>sees beyond the detailed, disjointed elements particular crimes</li></ul></li><li><b>Helpful problems </b><ul><li>enhance students understanding of basic principles</li><li>test their applications and interaction in the context of particular offenses</li></ul><p></p></li></ul></p><p></p><h2>Anthology of Post-Tonal Music</h2><p>This collection of 41 selections and excerpts represents a wide range of music from the 20th Century.

Thirty-nine people died and hundreds more lay wounded, making the Wall Street explosion the worst terrorist attack in U.S. history until the Oklahoma City bombing.<br><br>In <em>The Day Wall Street Exploded</em>, Beverly Gage tells the story of that once infamous but now largely forgotten event. Based on thousands of pages of Bureau of Investigation reports, this historical detective saga traces the four-year hunt for the perpetrators, a worldwide effort that spread as far as Italy and the new Soviet nation. It also gives readers the decades-long but little-known history of homegrown terrorism that helped to shape American society a century ago. The book delves into the lives of victims, suspects, and investigators: world banking power J.P. Morgan, Jr.; labor radical "Big Bill" Haywood; anarchist firebrands Emma Goldman and Luigi Galleani; "America's Sherlock Holmes," William J. Burns; even a young J. Edgar Hoover. It grapples as well with some of the most controversial events of its day, including the rise of the Bureau of Investigation, the federal campaign against immigrant "terrorists," the grassroots effort to define and protect civil liberties, and the establishment of anti-communism as the sine qua non of American politics. <br><br>Many Americans saw the destruction of the World Trade Center as the first major terrorist attack on American soil, an act of evil without precedent. <em>The Day Wall Street Exploded</em> reminds us that terror, too, has a history.<br><br><strong>Praise for the hardcover:</strong><br><br>"Outstanding."<br>--<em>New York Times Book Review</em><br><br>"Ms. Gage is a storyteller...she leaves it to her readers to draw their own connections as they digest her engaging narrative."<br>--<em>The New York Times</em><br><br>"Brisk, suspenseful and richly documented"<br>--<em>The Chicago Tribune</em><br><br>"An uncommonly intelligent, witty and vibrant account.

David Orr, an award-winning, internationally recognized leader in the field of sustainability and environmental education, pulls no punches: even with the Paris Agreement of 2015, Earth systems will not reach a new equilibrium for centuries. Earth is becoming a different planet&#x2014;more threadbare and less biologically diverse, with more acidic oceans and a hotter, more capricious climate. Furthermore, technology will not solve complex problems of sustainability.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yet we are not fated to destroy the Earth, Orr insists. He imagines sustainability as a quest and a transition built upon robust and durable democratic and economic institutions, as well as changes in heart and mindset. The transition, he writes, is beginning from the bottom up in communities and neighborhoods. He lays out specific principles and priorities to guide us toward enduring harmony between human and natural systems.&nbsp;</p><p><b>David W.

He outlines parents&#x2019; and teachers&#x2019; roles, suggesting ways in which they can work together to encourage any child to reach his or her potential. Finally, he reveals what we can learn from some of the most powerful motivators in the world: advertisers. With empathy and understanding, Lavoie offers parents and teachers the key to unlocking enthusiasm and responsiveness, proving any child can be motivated to learn.</p><p><b>Richard Lavoie, M.A., M.Ed.</b>, has worked as a teacher and headmaster at residential special education facilities for the past thirty years.

This awkwardly titled seminar was designed to acquaint teachers and parents with basic information about motivation, the impact of learning problems on motivation, and strategies to improve a student's efforts in the classroom and at home.</p><p>I was delivering the seminar to the faculty of a small Midwestern high school during a staff development day. Among the audience members was a stern-looking middle-aged gentleman who -- I later learned -- taught United States history and civics. He sat tight-lipped with his arms crossed firmly throughout the seminar. Although we never spoke to each other during the workshop, his body language clearly communicated that he was not buying what I was selling. He rolled his eyes and sighed audibly several times during my presentation. He shifted impatiently in his seat and glanced at his watch repeatedly. His behavior demonstrated that he had not begged his supervisor to allow him to attend a motivation workshop that day.</p><p>At the conclusion of the seminar, I opened the floor to questions. I was disheartened -- but not surprised -- to see this gentleman's hand shoot up. I acknowledged him and he stood and stared icily at me. "Your workshop had a lot of suggestions and plenty of reasons why kids aren't motivated to learn, but I am in total disagreement with your premise."</p><p>"And what is the source of our disagreement?" I asked, tentatively.</p><p>"Quite simply, <i>it's not my job to motivate these kids</i>. If they come to my class and they want to sit quietly and learn history, I will gladly give them the facts, information, and concepts that they need. If they are not motivated to learn, they can sit in the back of the class and sleep if they wish. It's their choice. It's their loss. I communicate information...and I do that very well. But if a kid doesn't care to learn it, that is not my problem. It's <i>his</i> problem. I'm a teacher, not a cheerleader."</p><p>We discussed...and argued...and debated...and dickered...and quarreled.</p><p>Because we disagreed so fundamentally on this issue, the discussion became quite heated. Finally, I said in some frustration, "But there are many legitimate reasons why a student can lack motivation: fear of failure, lack of understanding, learning disorders, frustration. Every learning theorist from Piaget to Gardner has stated that the learning process begins with motivation. Without motivation, there is no learning. Attempting to teach a child who is unmotivated is as futile as hammering on cold steel."</p><p>"But it's not my job!" he countered.</p><p>"It <i>is</i> your job, sir. Quite simply, kids don't come <i>with batteries included</i>. You've got to provide the batteries if you want them to function."</p><p>I don't believe that I was successful in changing the gentleman's mind, but our exchange <i>did</i> give me a better title for the seminar. I renamed the workshop "Batteries Not Included: Motivating the Struggling Learner," and have delivered programs throughout North America, Australia, Hong Kong, and New Zealand.</p><p>Most teachers and parents recognize that motivation is the key to learning. Reflect for a moment on your favorite teacher in high school. The chances are that he was an effective motivator. He inspired you. He was not merely a teacher, he was also a leader.</p><p>He did not necessarily make learning fun, but he made learning attainable and purposeful. Whether you serve children as a teacher, parent, coach, or instructor, you will multiply your effectiveness immeasurably if you learn how to motivate your charges and maintain that motivation throughout the learning process.</p><p>I began my study of student motivation in the twentieth year of my education career. I interviewed dozens of teachers about student motivation and was surprised and disheartened to find how little my colleagues knew about this important topic. The more I learned about this subject, the more I came to realize that I, also, did not have an effective repertoire of motivational techniques. I tended to use a "one size fits all" approach with my students wherein I expected all of the children to be motivated by the same star chart, checklist, or reward system. This broad approach left many children unmotivated and uninspired. I was able to motivate many of my students. I analyzed the approaches and strategies that were successful with these children. My successes, I came to recognize, were almost accidental -- nearly serendipitous. I made no conscious attempt to match the child to the motivational technique. I merely had the good fortune to use a motivational strategy that, by happenstance, seemed to inspire a particular child.</p><p>After observing one of my classes a generous superior once commented that I was "a natural motivator." I wasn't, and now that I have a better understanding of the intricacies of this complex process we call "motivation," I realize a truly "natural motivator" is a rare, rare person indeed. In order to establish and maintain the motivation of a fellow human being, or a classroom filled with fellow human beings, one must understand the complexities inherent in this elaborate motivation process.</p><p>It is important that adults learn what motivation is! But it is equally important that they <i>unlearn</i> what motivation is not! I have yet to find an undergraduate- or graduate-level curriculum that effectively addresses this fundamental concept. Teachers' lack of training and exposure to the basic tenets of childhood motivation results in a corps of American teachers who are unable to understand or implement effective motivational techniques.</p><p>The media bombards us incessantly with the bad news emanating from America's classrooms. Test scores are down, dropout rates are up, and school violence is on the rise while school attendance declines. Students' high-risk behaviors (drug use, sexual activity, delinquency) increase while SAT scores plummet in some communities. There are innumerable reasons for these statistics, many of which are beyond the control of parents and school personnel. But student motivation is clearly a factor in these upsetting educational trends. This fact should serve as a clarion call to America's parents and professionals to focus time, energy, and other resources on the study and exploration of motivation.</p><p>This book is designed to explore and, to a degree, demystify the complex process of motivating school-aged children. First, we will explore and explode some of the most common myths and misconceptions that impact our understanding of motivation. Following this <i>unlearning</i>, the processes of <i>learning</i> and <i>relearning</i> can begin. Second, we will discuss and demonstrate the significant impact that learning disorders can have upon a student's ability to maintain his motivation in the classroom, at home, and on the playing field.</p><p>The final, and perhaps primary, focus of the book will be a collection of field-tested strategies designed to create, foster, and maintain the motivation of children in a variety of settings.</p><p>It is not overstating the case to say that our nation's future depends greatly on our ability to motivate our children today. This fact should inspire all adults to become more effective motivators. In the sage words of Charles Kettering, "My interest is in the future because I am going to spend the rest of my life there."</p><p>Myths and Misconceptions About Student Motivation</p><p></p><blockquote>"Do something. If it works, do more of it. If it doesn't...do something else." -- Franklin Delano Roosevelt</blockquote> <p>Today's teachers and parents should heed FDR's sage advice. Often, we continue to repeatedly use traditional "motivational techniques" despite the obvious fact that these strategies are not working effectively. I recall a simmering teacher bringing an errant and unmotivated student into my office and complaining, "I have kept Josh in for recess <i>fifteen days in a row</i> and he <i>still</i> isn't doing his math homework."</p><p>Well, let's circle the slow learner in this picture. The strategy is not working. Try something else!</p><p>Because we are unable to inspire our students by igniting their intrinsic (internal) motivation, we try to motivate them extrinsically by establishing a complex tapestry of tests, quizzes, evaluations, and grades. In effect, we <i>force</i> them to be motivated to master the targeted curriculum. ("I know that you will never need to use these algebra equations in real life, Tucker, but you <i>must</i> learn them because they will be on Friday's test.") This unrelenting coercion seems to be a rather unfair use of our power over children. We can do better.</p><p>I have come to recognize that most teachers and parents adhere to a false and shaky set of beliefs related to motivation. These misconceptions must be shelved before we can embrace a more enlightened motivational approach.<i></i></p><p><i><b>Motivation Myth #1</b></i></p><p><i>"That Danny...NOTHING motivates that kid."</i></p><p>Any teacher or parent who makes this statement is displaying a sad lack of knowledge about the true nature of student motivation.</p><p>We must come to understand the most basic tenet of human motivation. This concept is the keystone upon which the remaining pages of this book rest. The simple but profound concept is the following: <i>All human behavior is motivated!</i></p><p>EVERY behavior that we manifest on any given day is motivated. If a reader decides to stop reading this book at this point, I cannot state that the person is "not motivated." She was motivated to <i>stop reading</i>. If a friend of mine stops calling me on a weekly basis, I cannot say, "He is unmotivated to maintain the friend...</p></p><h2>Cultural Diversity and Families: Expanding Perspectives</h2><p>Cultural Diversity and Families: Expanding Perspectives breaks new ground by investigating how concepts of cultural diversity have shaped the study of families from theoretical and applied perspectives.

Soon, his abuse of these substances surpassed experimentation and became a ruthless addiction to heroin that nearly destroyed his life.<br><br>Now in recovery, Keegan tells his remarkable story in <em>Chasing the High</em>. Starting with the early days of alcohol and drug use, Keegan charts his decline into crime and homelessness as his need for heroin surpassed all thoughts of family and friends, of right and wrong. He then goes on to use these experiences to offer guidance and practical advice to other young people who may be struggling with substance abuse. In straightforward, easy-to-understand language and along with the psychiatric expertise of Howard Moss, MD, Keegan discusses what is known about the neurobiology of addiction in young people, how to seek treatment, and how to get the most out of professional help. He also covers such topics as therapies which are used to combat addiction, how to talk to families and friends about substance abuse, and how to navigate risky situations. Both an absorbing memoir and a useful resource for young people.<br><br>Part of the Adolescent Mental Health Initiative series of books written specifically for teens and young adults, <em>Chasing the High</em> offers hope to young people who are struggling with substance abuse, helping them to overcome its challenges and to go on to lead healthy, productive lives.<br></p><p><br><strong>Kyle Keegan</strong> is a professional diver. He lives in New York with his wife and daughters. <br><strong>Howard B. Moss, MD,</strong> is Associate Director for Clinical and Translational Research with the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institutes of Health.<br><br>"The book provides a wealth of up-to-date information about the neurobiology of addiction and explains why teens are at a higher risk for drug abuse than adults...short excerpts from other addiction memoirs add to Keegan's wrenching story."--<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"This heartfelt, powerfully written book is an easy read and a first choice for all collections."--<em>Lorraine B. Wiener, teacher, in the</em> School Library Journal<p></p><br>"<em>Chasing the High</em> is an excellent resource on substance abuse for adolescents and their families. Keegan's personal story captures the experience of addiction and recovery in a compelling manner. The authors even make the neurobiology of addiction clear and accessible. It is difficult to find good resources about addictive drugs for adolescents and this book fills the gap."--<em>Charles Dackis, M.D., Director, Charles O'Brien Center for Addiction Treatment, University of Pennsylvania</em><p></p><br>"<em>Chasing the High</em> is honest and intense, yet also extremely informative. Kyle Keegan has written a brave cautionary tale that takes his readers deep inside the belly of addiction. This book speaks to anyone who has ever felt the deadly grip of drugs and alcohol take hold, but also to those who have watched someone they love disappear into a dark cloud of chemicals. Bravo to Kyle for having the courage to share his painful and inspiring story with the world."--<em>Lynn Marie Smith, author of</em> Rolling Away: My Agony with Ecstasy<p></p><br>"While the perils of addiction are often lost in detailed data, there remains a lacuna of information on the personal tolls of substance abuse. In <em>Chasing the High</em> we are given an intriguing and very personal snapshot of the initiation, maintenance, and subsequent battling of severe chemical dependency-intermixed with factual and useful information about additions. Along with the author, we experience the tribulations of the addition- from the crashes to the euphoria to the rehabilitation and optimism of experiencing life without drugs. <em>Chasing the High</em> provides a unique inside perspective on addiction that is often lost in academic texts."--<em>Timothy E. Wilens, M.D., Massachusetts General Hospital &amp; Harvard Medical School</em><p></p><br>"<em>Chasing the High</em> by Keegan and Moss is wonderful first-hand account of a young person's development with addiction. With powerful descriptions of the events that led to drug use, abuse, and addiction the authors succeed in weaving a primer on addiction within the developing saga. Engaging and easy to read, this book should be an enormous help for those individuals and families struggling with this disorder to understand addiction. Particularly poignant for this researcher is the repeated focus on the "dark side" of addiction. The author states, 'In fact, you're taking drugs now not so much to feel good as to keep from feeling bad.' The authors illustrate so clearly that seeking drugs to fill emotional holes creates even bigger emotional holes that in turn need to be filled. This phenomenon is the core feature of addiction."--<em>George F.

C. D. Godshalk's inner-city drug dealer yearns to be a prep-school student, while Patricia Henley's young narrator unwillingly forgives her mother, whose alcoholism scatters the narrator and her siblings into foster homes and institutions. Dennis McFarland's protagonist must watch his best buddy die of AIDS, and an older colleague's disintegration compels Richard Bausch's generally noncontemplative middle-aged priest to obsess about his own health. Joan Wickersham depicts a wife who bonds with her Brooklyn roommates to the exclusion of her out-of-town hubbie, and Elizabeth Tallent demonstrates how a happily remarried man can begrudge his ex-wife the company of their son. Set during the decline of the Hapsburg empire, Steven Millhauser's story of a Jewish illusionist who may have sold his soul to the devil for the gift of magic is foil to the volume's prevailing themes of modern angst. Slighter efforts by Madison Smartt Bell, Siri Hustvedt, Pamela Houston and Joy Williams also appear here, as does an introduction by Ford ( Rock Springs ) who explains his choice of two stories each by Bausch and Alice Munro and six from the New Yorker. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.For whatever reason, co-editor Ford claims he made no effort to balance the number of male authors against female or stories from small magazines against those from larger ones or "to include some percentage of gays or Chicanos or African Americans or Jews." The result is predictable: most of these authors are celebrities, and of the 20 stories, six are from The New Yorker alone. Overall, one wishes there had been more of the generous goofball spirit of Padgett Powell's "Typical," which is about a deadbeat who keeps his girlfriends' numbers on candy wrappers on the floor of his truck.

Indeed, galumphing around stages across the country, joking his way through one grotesque thermonuclear scenario after another, he came frighteningly close. In telling the story of Herman Kahn, whose 1960 book <i>On Thermonuclear War</i> catapulted him into celebrity, Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi captures an era that is still very much with us--a time whose innocence, gruesome nuclear humor, and outrageous but deadly serious visions of annihilation have their echoes in the "known unknowns and unknown unknowns" that guide policymakers in our own embattled world. </p><p> </p><p> Portraying a life that combined aspects of Lenny Bruce, Hitchcock, and Kubrick, Ghamari-Tabrizi presents not one Herman Kahn, but many--one who spoke the suffocatingly dry argot of the nuclear experts, another whose buffoonery conveyed the ingenious absurdity of it all, and countless others who capered before the public, ambiguous, baffling, always open to interpretation. This, then, is a story of one thoroughly strange and captivating man as well as a cultural history of our moment. In Herman Kahn's world is a critical lesson about how Cold War analysts learned to fill in the ciphers of strategic uncertainty, and thus how we as a nation learned to live with the peculiarly inventive quality of strategy, in which uncertainty generates extravagant threat scenarios. </p><p> </p><p> Revealing the metaphysical behind the dryly deliberate, apparently practical discussion of nuclear strategy, this book depicts the creation of a world where clever men fashion Something out of Nothing--and establishes Herman Kahn as our first virtuoso of the unknown unknowns. </p></p><p>Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi is an independent scholar living in Florida.Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi gives us a sober, fabulous, research-rich portrait of Herman Kahn, the early years of the RAND Corporation, and the eruption of the nuclear war-gaming scenario and strategic futurology. This is a book that can help us unlearn the official versions of the terrors let loose on this earth. (Donna Haraway)<br><br>One of the smartest, most engaging, and informed Cold War studies I've read. (Michael Sherry)<br><br>If we have forgotten Hermann Kahn we have forgotten a vision of the Cold War of the first importance. Computer modelling, thermonuclear exchanges, survivable fallout shelters, post-war scenarios--Kahn was in the thick of these debates and his views shaped the way military planning was conceived. Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi captures this remarkable and terrifying time through Kahn's work. And in the process has delivered to us a riveting, original, and troubling image of the calculus of modern war. (Peter Galison)<br><br>Herman Kahn is perhaps best known (to those who know of him at all) as the model for Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. In fact, this physicist turned defense analyst achieved notoriety in the 1950s and '60s by articulating a vision of what a postnuclear-war world might look like, arguing that since it might be possible to survive a nuclear war, it was essential to plan to do just that. Ghamari-Tabrizi is superb at providing, in compelling narrative, the cultural context for Kahn, his work and some of his more outlandish statements...He was vilified for his beliefs and, as the author so capably demonstrates, he seemed to love every second of it...Ghamari-Tabrizi provides a fascinating look at a complex man--at once 'visionary' and 'quixotic'--who was thinking, as the author says, about the unthinkable. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2005-02-28)<br><br>In 1961, Amitai Etzioni said that Herman Kahn 'does for nuclear arms what free-love advocates did for sex: he speaks candidly of acts about which others whisper behind closed doors.' Kahn, one of the nuclear analysts whom the RAND Corporation paid to think about the unthinkable, did not just stand out from his cold-blooded brethren; he ballooned out from them. This 'artless, sweaty man,' wheezing and gulping down water, was almost cartoonishly fat, a rotund prophet giggling at the apocalypse. Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi's suitably macabre <i>The Worlds of Herman Kahn</i> shows us both the clownish appearance and the deadly serious mind. (Warren Bass <i>Washington Post</i> 2005-03-20)<br><br>Herman Kahn (1922-83) was a cold war original whose notoriously sensational ideas, embodied in his <i>On Thermonuclear War</i> (1960), were later satirized in Dr. Strangelove . Though the inspiration for the movie's namesake character, the real Kahn could not have been less menacing. A rotund, joke--cracking extrovert, the loquacious Kahn reveled in prodding presumptions that nuclear war was too horrible to contemplate. The contrast between Kahn's joviality and his apologia for global genocide is one of the worlds of Kahn that Ghamari-Tabrizi surveys. Others are Kahn's think-tank society of civilian defense intellectuals and their simulations of warfare, and her consideration of Kahn's ruminations about waging and surviving nuclear war 'as a style, a mood, and an aesthetic.' If it seems strange to treat theories of nuclear warfare as an art form, the fantastical scenarios that Kahn batted around justify Ghamari-Tabrizi's approach. Her exploration of Kahn falls in line with the contemporary fad for demented comedy, and a Ghamari-Tabrizi unbounded by a political-science stricture will attract readership beyond the wonks. (Gilbert Taylor <i>Booklist</i> 2005-04-15)<br><br>[In her] highly engaging book...Ghamari-Tabrizi sets out with gusto to attack what she calls Kahn's 'comic metaphysics.' (Christopher Coker <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2005-06-10)<br><br>Sharon Ghamari-Tabrizi's <i>The Worlds of Herman Kahn</i> is an attempt to look at Kahn as a cultural phenomenon...Ghamari-Tabrizi thinks that if nuclear strategy is a science it is, at best, an 'intuitive science,' more imaginative than empirical, and she relies a lot on the vocabulary of literary criticism to interpret it: the grotesque, the fantastic, the uncanny, the hardboiled, 'the aesthetic of spontaneity,' 'serious play.' She does not withhold judgment about the merits of Kahn's work, but she is interested mainly in the feel of the moment, the moods and tastes of a time when the Cold War, and the anxious talk that swirled around it, had many Americans scared almost to death. It is an adventurous approach, and rewarding when it works. (Louis Menand <i>New Yorker</i> 2005-06-27)<br><br>The 'affable psychopath' and his times are vividly reconstructed in <i>The Worlds of Herman Kahn</i>...Ghamari-Tabrizi, an independent scholar who specializes in the social studies of science and technology, tracks his uncanny ideas and public meanings and in the process excavates the Cold War in ways that resonate eerily with the present war on terror...Kahn freely used fiction throughout his work and was sometimes impatient with tedious empiricism, proposing that it did not matter what had actually happened, only what could have happened. His books were full of numbers, but the numbers and graphs measured nothing real, describing only hypothetical events and future possibilities. His ideas oscillated along the edge of reason and unreason, fact and fiction. Ghamari-Tabrizi's compelling work illuminates the chilling potential of that edge, both for Kahn's time and for our own. <i>The Worlds of Herman Kahn</i> is a book that should be widely read. (Susan Lindee <i>Science</i> 2005-07-15)<br><br>This is a thoroughly researched and well-written and argued book--much more readable than either of Kahn's ponderous tomes.

Angry rioters burned draft offices, closed factories, destroyed railroad tracks and telegraph lines, and hunted policemen and soldiers. Before long, the rioters turned their murderous wrath against the black community. In the end, at least 105 people were killed, making the draft riots the most violent insurrection in American history.<br> In this vividly written book, Iver Bernstein tells the compelling story of the New York City draft riots. He details how what began as a demonstration against the first federal draft soon expanded into a sweeping assault against the local institutions and personnel of Abraham Lincoln's Republican Party as well as a grotesque race riot. Bernstein identifies participants, dynamics, causes and consequences, and demonstrates that the "winners" and "losers" of the July 1863 crisis were anything but clear, even after five regiments rushed north from Gettysburg restored order. In a tour de force of historical detection, Bernstein shows that to evaluate the significance of the riots we must enter the minds and experiences of a cast of characters--Irish and German immigrant workers, Wall Street businessmen who frantically debated whether to declare martial law, nervous politicians in Washington and at City Hall. Along the way, he offers new perspectives on a wide range of topics: Civil War society and politics, patterns of race, ethnic and class relations, the rise of organized labor, styles of leadership, philanthropy and reform, strains of individualism, and the rise of machine politics in Boss Tweed's Tammany regime.<br> An in-depth study of one of the most troubling and least understood crises in American history, <em>The New York City Draft Riots</em> is the first book to reveal the broader political and historical context--the complex of social, cultural and political relations--that made the bloody events of July 1863 possible.</p><p><br><em>About the author</em>:<br> <strong>Iver Bernstein</strong> is Assistant Professor of History at Washington University, St. Louis. He was awarded the George Washington Eggleston Prize by Yale University in 1985 for the doctoral dissertation that is the basis of this book.<br><br> "An original work in the historiography of Civil War America and labor history, and also synthesizes much of the current historical research. It stimulates and provokes. Most important, it recaptures much of the world we have lost."--New York Times Book Review<br> "Especially appealing....When Bernstein crosses historical genres, it's an almost synesthetic pleasure....The New York City Draft Riots establishes a world as it was lived in. Its outline shows clearly against the backdrop of our own populist racism, in what is still the unreconstructed North."--Village Voice<br> "An outstanding piece of social, economic, and political history, suggesting the benefits of integrating new and older historiography, the book also illustrates a pitfall or two that historians may wish to keep in mind.....An excellent, revelatory book....His writing is clear and his immense research shines on every page."--Reviews in American History<br> "Detailed and sophisticated....An impressive book. Bernstein displays ingenuity in conceiving of the riots as something more than an abrupt, momentary episode, and he has dug deep to locate sources....Clearly the new interpretive authority."--Georgia Historical Quarterly<br> "Not since David Montgomery's Beyond Equality (1967) has the relationship between Civil War politics and the social history of the urban-industrial North been explored so successfully as in this study."--Journal of American History<br></p><h2>Between Equal Rights: A Marxist Theory of International Law (Historical Materialism)</h2><p><p>&#x201c;China Mieville&#x2019;s brilliantly original book is an indispensable guide for anyone concerned with international law.

It started the revolution in patients working with their doctors and using humor to boost their bodies' capacity for healing. When Norman Cousins was diagnosed with a crippling and irreversible disease, he forged an unusual collaboration with his physician, and together they were able to beat the odds. The doctor's genius was in helping his patient to use his own powers: laughter, courage, and tenacity. The patient's talent was in mobilizing his body's own natural resources, proving what an effective healing tool the mind can be. This remarkable story of the triumph of the human spirit is truly inspirational reading.</p><p>Norman Cousins was a longtime editor of the Saturday Review and the author of eleven books on health and healing, among other works.&#x201c;Amazing and heartening.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Chicago Sun-Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;An entertaining and instructive example of an inspired participation of a patient in his own treatment.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Washington Post</em></strong></p><h2>Dictionary of Banking Terms (Barron&#39;s Business Guides)</h2><p>More than 3,000 key terms related to banking, financing, and money management are clearly and concisely defined in this volume which also offers a good review of the many banking services that are available today. An indispensable reference for banking and finance professional, and business students, this book is also a good starting point for value-conscious consumers who want up-to-date information about consumer finance.</p><p>The changes in the banking industry over the last decade have spawned a greatly expanded vocabulary, and "Barron's Business Guides" has responded with a dictionary which will be of great service to bankers, business and management professionals, attorneys, investors, and librarians. The diminutive size of the book (4 3/16 x 7) belies its breadth. Not only are cogent definitions included, but author Fitch wisely adds longer discussions where needed. He summarizes key banking- and securities-related laws and provides a table of acronyms as well as extensive cross references. The financial community will find this an invaluable reference tool, as will libraries with business collections of any depth.<br><i>- Joan Pedzich, Harris, Beach &amp; Wilcox Lib., Rochester, N.Y.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Encyclopaedia of the Viking Age</h2><p>Reveals not only how the Vikings successfully and brutally conquered vast areas of eastern and western Europe, but also how they dressed, spent their leisure time, farmed and cooked, and buried and celebrated their dead.</p><p>John Haywood is an Honorary Teaching Fellow in the Department of History at the University of Lancaster and a Fellow of the Royal Historical Society of Great Britain. He is the author of several books, including <i>The Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings</i>.Haywood's attractive encyclopedia on the Vikings is that rarity--a satisfying reference source done right. The book is modestly sized and priced but packed with information. From the preface and introduction to the source list at the back, Haywood, who also wrote <i>The </i>Penguin Historical Atlas of the Vikings (1995), is a master of his subject. His prose is ample, at times challenging, but never pedantic. He anticipates the needs of the student, historian, teacher, librarian, traveler, and researcher with three superb gray-and-white maps of voyages, ports, and boundaries minus fussy cartographic extras that get in the way. A handy addition is a prefatory subject list offering such enticing topics as <i>Dwarves</i>, <i>Khazars,</i> <i>Ladby ship burial</i>, <i>Midgard Ser</i>pent, and <i>Slave trade</i>. At back, the reader finds more useful study aids: a two-page historical chronology and three pages of Viking kings and rulers spanning the years 700 to 1100.The body of the encyclopedia assigns more than a third of each page to crisp, captioned black-and-white photographs and drawings. These illustrations span the top of each page and connect solidly to topics below. For example, an aerial photo showing the layout of a ninth-century ring-fort in the center of the modern Dutch village of Oost-Souburg complements the entry <i>Ring-forts, </i>Frankish; and a sketch of the Kanhave showing how engineers separated water and land accompanies the entry for this major eighth-century Danish engineering project. Unlike volumes that focus on Viking he-men, Haywood surveys all of Scandinavian life from the period, offering two intricate line drawings of an upright loom; entries on <i>Jewelry</i>, <i>Life expectancy</i>, and <i>Weights </i>and measures; and details concerning courtship, marriage, children, and divorce. Dotting each topic are cross-references in small caps that entice the reader to go beyond succinct data to a full understanding of the bold, inventive Vikings. Rich details on ship settings, road building, and Offa's dyke stress the geographic remains of their civilization. Balancing temporal exploits are the lasting intellectual and artistic monuments--rune-edged steles, filigreed carvings, bronze artifacts, illuminated documents, laws, and the wealth of sagas, riddles, and skaldic verse that set Scandinavia apart from the more genteel Europeans to the south and west.In terms of size, layout, cost, and ease of use, Haywood's encyclopedia is a worthy challenger to Peter Sawyer's <i>The Age of Vikings </i>(St. Martin's, 1962) and <i>The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings</i> (1997). Its one weakness is limited access to subtopics. Alphabetized cross-references are scanty. Without a back index, the book deprives the user of quick retrieval of details on such minor figures as Freydis, the female voyager of the Eriksson family; and Snorri, child of Gudrid and Thorfinn Karlsefni and the first European born in the Americas. This concern aside, the volume should prove useful in public and academic libraries. REVWR<br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Now, one of the giants of biological science, Christian de Duve, discusses what we've learned in this half century, ranging from the tiniest cells to the future of our species and of life itself. <br> With wide-ranging erudition, De Duve takes us on a dazzling tour of the biological world, beginning with the invisible workings of the cell, the area in which he won his Nobel Prize. He describes how the first cells may have arisen and suggests that they may have been like the organisms that exist today near deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Contrary to many scientists, he argues that life was bound to arise and that it probably only took millennia--maybe tens of thousands of years--to move from rough building blocks to the first organisms possessing the basic properties of life. With equal authority, De Duve examines topics such as the evolution of humans, the origins of consciousness, the development of language, the birth of science, and the origin of emotion, morality, altruism, and love. He concludes with his conjectures on the future of humanity--for instance, we may evolve, perhaps via genetic engineering, into a new species--and he shares his personal thoughts about God and immortality. <br> In <em>Life Evolving</em>, one of our most eminent scientists sums up what he has learned about the nature of life and our place in the universe. An extraordinarily wise and humane volume, it will fascinate readers curious about the world around them and about the impact of science on philosophy and religion.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christian de Duve</strong> won the Nobel Prize in 1974 for his work on the organization of the cell. One of the best-known pioneers of cell biology, he is head of the Christian de Duve Institute of Cellular Pathology. He is the author of <em>Vital Dust: Life as a Cosmic Imperative, Blueprint for a Cell: The</em> <em>Nature and Origins of Life</em>, and <em>A Guided Tour of the Living Cell</em>. He shares his time between New York and Brussels.<br><br>"A well-written, engaging scientific tour de force.... de Duve exhibits an extraordinary skill in conveying his deep knowledge of biology.... Both a first-rate scholar and an accomplished popularizer of science...de Duve moves with equal familiarity and eloquence from scientific papers to French poets.... <em>Life Evolving</em> forces the reader to avoid intellectual complacency and to articulate one's own arguments to effectively address his position. These are, in themselves, major reasons to appreciate the book."--<em>Science</em><p></p><br>"This book is addressed to the educated lay person interested in the origin of life, its evolution to the present day and its philosophical implications. The reader is in for a treat of unsurpassed lucid and poetic writing. It is the testament of one of the great biologist-philosophers of our time."--Gunter Blobel, Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine<p></p><br>"An original thinker and graceful writer, Christian de Duve is an E.O. Wilson for the cell. In <em>Life Evolving</em>, De Duve lays bare the molecular machinery of life, finding both explanation of our evolutionary past and signs of what it will mean to be human in the twenty-first century."--Andrew H.

This compelling biography of the most powerful European monarch of his day begins with his conception (1526) and ends with his ascent to Paradise (1603), two occurrences surprisingly well documented by contemporaries. Eminent historian Geoffrey Parker draws on four decades of research on Philip as well as a recent, extraordinary archival discovery&#x2014;a trove of 3,000 documents in the vaults of the Hispanic Society of America in New York City, unread since crossing Philip&#x2019;s own desk more than four centuries ago. Many of them change significantly what we know about the king.<br> &nbsp;<br> The book examines Philip&#x2019;s long apprenticeship; his three principal interests (work, play, and religion); and the major political, military, and personal challenges he faced during his long reign. Parker offers fresh insights into the causes of Philip&#x2019;s leadership failures: was his empire simply too big to manage, or would a monarch with different talents and temperament have fared better?</p><p><b>Geoffrey Parker</b> is Distinguished University Professor, Andreas Dorpalen Professor of European History, and associate of the Mershon Center, Ohio State University."Parker&#x2019;s highly detailed but also immensely readable book has come far closer to that than any previous account of the most enigmatic of Spanish kings."&#x2014;Anthony Pagden, <i>New York Times Book Review </i>on<i> The Grand Strategy of Philip II</i><br>"He is at pains to know Philip through the testimony of his friends, foes, courtiers and his own words and this authoritative, intelligently revisionist biography must stand now as the primary reference."&#x2014;Iain Finlayson,<i>&nbsp;Times</i><br>"Parker has managed to navigate the archival whirlpools with remarkable flair. His admiration for his subject is evident on almost every page, yet the book is no whitewash. We are constantly made aware of the possibility that Philip might be deceiving us."&#x2014;Fernando Cervantes, <i>TLS</i><br>"The research . . . is astoundingly thorough and impressive. The writing is superb. . . . This biography is as definitive as definitive' can get. And, best of all, it's as splendid a book as one could ever hope to read."&#x2014;Carlos Eire, <i>Books &amp; Culture</i><br>"This is no mere updating of Parker's previous work on Philip, though. It is the consummate biography of the king, the mature reflection of a master historian at the height of his craft writing about the subject he knows best."&#x2014;<i>MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History</i><br>"A splendid biography of Philip II, ruler of Spain and the world&#x2019;s greatest empire. In short, highly readable chapters, the author examines Philip&#x2019;s youth and education for his future role. . . .Based heavily on extensive research in primary sources and a cache of previously unknown documents.

This, together with Parker&#x2019;s unique gift as a historian, makes <i>Imprudent King </i>a profound, original and engaging new interpretation of the king&#x2019;s life and of the manner in which he wrestled with the almost hopeless task of managing the first truly world empire."<i>&#x2014;</i>Teofilo F.

Alon investigates networks at a higher level, including genomic regulatory networks. He does an excellent job of explaining and motivating a useful toolbox of engineering models and methods using network-based controls. ... will be a valuable and non-overlapping addition to a systems-biology curriculum."<br>&#x2015;Eric Werner, Department of Physiology, Anatomy and Genetics, University of Oxford, <em>Nature,</em> Vol. 446, No. 29, March 2007 <br><br>"I read Uri Alon&#x2019;s elegant book almost without stopping for breath.

Here, in a riveting environmental fable that recalls Peter Benchley's thriller Jaws, journalist David Baron traces the history of the mountain lion and chronicles Boulder's effort to coexist with its new neighbors. A parable for our times, <em>The Beast in the Garden</em> is a scientific detective story and a real-life drama, a tragic tale of the struggle between two highly evolved predators: man and beast. 4 photos, 5 maps</p><p>David Baron, an award-winning journalist and author of The&nbsp;Beast in the Garden, is a former science correspondent for NPR and former science editor for the public radio program The World. An incurable umbraphile whose passion for chasing eclipses began in 1998, he lives in Boulder, Colorado.In 1991, in Idaho Springs, Colo., a small town not far from Boulder, a young jogger was killed and partially eaten by a mountain lion. Although people were horrified, biologist Michael Sanders and naturalist Jim Halfpenny were not surprised. Since 1988 they had been studying the mountain lions that were invading backyards in the Boulder area in increasing numbers and had concluded that, contrary to the accepted wisdom that these lions don't attack people, the big cats were indeed stalking humans in search of a good meal. In an engrossing book that reads like a true crime thriller, Baron, a science and environmental writer, follows the advance of mountain lions around Boulder as if they were serial killers, building tension as he leads up to the killing. There were plenty of warnings. Numerous homeowners saw lions in their yards, dogs were maimed or eaten and a girl was attacked but survived. Sanders and Halfpenny tried to convince the wildlife-loving Boulderites that a tragedy was about to occur, but people believed they could coexist peacefully with the lions, and the Colorado Division of Wildlife was also determined to leave the animals alone. Even after Scott Lancaster, the Idaho Springs jogger, was killed, area residents refused to endorse killing the big cats that moved into their neighborhoods. Baron is not in favor of killing unwanted lions, but in this timely book he warns that as people continue to displace wild animals from their habitats, they have to change the way they interact with them and be more realistic about romantic notions of wilderness.

Considering the urban landscape not from the abstract perspective of an urban planner but from the viewpoint of an attentive observer, Urban Code offers 100 &#x201c;lessons&#x201d;&#x2015;maxims, observations, and bite-size truths, followed by short essays&#x2015;that teach us how to read the city. This is a user's guide to the city, a primer of urban literacy, at the pedestrian level. The reader (like the observant city stroller) can move from &#x201c;People walk in the sunshine&#x201d; (lesson 1) to &#x201c;Street vendors are positioned according to the path of the sun&#x201d; (lesson 2); consider possible connections between the fact that &#x201c;Locals and tourists use the streets at different times&#x201d; (lesson 41) and &#x201c;Tourists stand still when they're looking at something&#x201d; (lesson 68); and weigh the apparent contradiction of lesson 73, &#x201c;Nightlife hotspots increase pedestrian traffic&#x201d; and lesson 74, &#x201c;People are afraid of the dark.&#x201d;</p><p>A lesson may seem self-evident (&#x201c;Grocery stores are important local destinations&#x201d;&#x2015;of course they are!) but considered in the context of other lessons, it becomes part of a natural logic. With Urban Code, we learn what to notice if we want to understand the city. We learn to detect patterns in the relationships between people and the urban environment. Each lesson is accompanied by an icon-like image; in addition to these 100 drawings, thirty photographs of street scenes illustrate the text. The photographs are stills from films shot in the Manhattan neighborhood of SoHo; the lessons are inspired by the authors' observations of SoHo, but hold true for any cityscape.</p></p><p>Anne Mikoleit is a research scientist and PhD candidate, teaching architecture and urban design in the Department of Architecture at ETH Zurich.<p>The effect of Urban Code is a multimodal, almost helter skelter, accretive and cumulative, indirect yet structured, obvious and concurrently nuanced, simple while sophisticated, zen-like in its quiet message, yet powerfully provocative in its impact.</p>&#x2015;<b>Stephen E.

Leave your reading glasses behind. Now Roger Tory Peterson&#39;s classic Field Guide to Eastern Birds has been reissued in a larger format specially produced for those who don&#39;t want to take their reading glasses into the field. Peterson&#39;s treasured illustrations have been reproduced in beautiful color. Species descriptions include only the most important identification elements -- size, voice, and habitat -- in large, easy-to-read type. Color range maps, conveniently located next to the species accounts, have been updated specifically for this book. Roger Tory Peterson&#39;s original text has been revised and updated by Virginia Peterson, who worked closely with her husband and created the maps for the fourth edition of the Field Guide to Eastern Birds; Noble Proctor, a professor of biology who was a close friend of Roger Tory Peterson&#39;s and led natural history tours for twenty-five years; and Pete Dunne, vice president of the New Jersey Audubon Society and director of the Cape May Bird Observatory, as well as the author of many books on birding. The maps have been updated by Virginia Peterson and Paul Lehman, past editor of Birding magazine and a bird tour leader who has traveled extensively around North America studying bird distribution and identification and has written many articles on these subjects.</p><p>ROGER TORY PETERSON, one of the world&#x2019;s greatest naturalists, received every major award for ornithology, natural science, and conservation as well as numerous honorary degrees, medals, and citations, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

The Peterson Identification System has been called the greatest invention since binoculars.Veteran birders will know how to use this book. Beginners, however, <br>should spend some time becoming familiar in a general way with the <br>illustrations. They are not arranged in systematic or phylogenetic <br>order as in most ornithological works but are grouped in 8 main <br>visual categories:<br><br> (1) Swimmers &#x2014; Ducks and ducklike birds<br> (2) Aerialists &#x2014; Gulls and gull-like birds<br> (3) Long-legged Waders &#x2014; Herons, cranes, etc.<br> (4) Smaller Waders &#x2014; Plovers, sandpipers, etc.<br> (5) Fowl-like Birds &#x2014; Grouse, quail, etc.<br> (6) Birds of Prey &#x2014; Hawks, eagles, owls<br> (7) Nonpasserine Land Birds<br> (8) Passerine (Perching) Birds<br><br> Within these groupings it will be seen that ducks do not <br>resemble loons; gulls are readily distinguishable from terns. The <br>needlelike bills of warblers immediately differentiate them from the <br>seed-cracking bills of sparrows. Birds that could be confused are <br>grouped together when possible and are arranged in identical profile <br>for direct comparison. The arrows point to outstanding "field marks" <br>which are explained opposite.</p><h2>The Public Burning (Coover, Robert)</h2><p>A controversial best-seller in 1977, The Public Burning has since emerged as one of the most influential novels of our time. The first major work of contemporary fiction ever to use living historical figures as characters, the novel reimagines the three fateful days in 1953 that culminated with the execution of alleged atomic spies Julius and Ethel Rosenberg. Vice-President Richard Nixon - the voraciously ambitious bad boy of the Eisenhower regime - is the dominant narrator in an enormous cast that includes Betty Crocker, Joe McCarthy, the Marx Brothers, Walter Winchell, Uncle Sam, his adversary The Phantom, and Time magazine incarnated as the National Poet Laureate. All of these and thousands more converge in Times Square for the carnivalesque auto-da-fe at which the Rosenbergs are put to death. And not a person present escapes implication in Cold War America&#39;s ruthless &#34;public burning.&#34;</p><p>For quite some time after the 1977 publication of <i>The Public Burning</i>, it was almost impossible to find a copy. The book's own publisher seemed--no, <i>was</i> reluctant to admit it even existed. That's because this imaginative reconstruction of the 1953 execution of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, convicted for giving atom bomb secrets to the Soviets, was the first major work of modern fiction to feature a still-living historical figure as a prominent character. The book's obscurity was the publisher's attempt to avoid legal repercussions from Richard Nixon, who over the course of the book engages in a romantic interlude with Ethel Rosenberg and graphically surrenders himself to a rapacious Uncle Sam.<p> Now that Nixon's dead, however, readers are free to marvel at one of the few American novels to rival Joyce's <i>Ulysses</i> for sustained stylistic inventiveness. Snippets of speeches and articles from <i>Time</i> are recast in poetic form, entire scenes are presented in dramatic verse, as events in the Rosenberg case move towards their historically destined conclusion. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p></p><h2>Stories (Vintage Classics)</h2><p>Although Katherine Mansfield was closely associated with D.H. Lawrence and something of a rival of Virginia Woolf, her stories suggest someone writing in a different era and in a vastly different English. Her language is as transparent as clean glass, yet hovers on the edge of poetry. Her characters are passionate men and women swaddled in English reserve -- and sometimes briefly breaking through. And her genius is to pinpoint those unacknowledged and almost imperceptible moments in which those people&#39;s relationships -- with one another and themselves -- change forever. This collection includes such masterpieces as &#34;Prelude,&#34; &#34;At the Bay&#34; &#34;Bliss,&#34; &#34;The Man Without a Temperament&#34; and &#34;The Garden Party&#34; and has a new introduction by Jeffrey Meyers.</p><p>Her stories suggest someone writing in a different era and in a vastly different English.

He worked at <i>The New York Times</i> for twenty-five years and was a licensed New York City tour guide before moving to Dallas, Texas, where he currently resides.</p>Imposing the unexplained and presumably arbitrary limit of 1000 buildings, New York City photographer Brockmann has selected, with a discerning eye, buildings distinguished by their opulence, historical significance, prominence, size, or architectural merit. He treats the five boroughs with relative evenness, although northern Manhattan is seriously underrepresented. What this volume lacks in comprehensiveness, however-and for that the AIA Guide to New York City is without peer-it compensates for with an elegant "portrait" (Brockmann's term) of every building. Each photograph reveals an essential aspect of the building through a keen sense of the descriptive capabilities of natural light. The composition of the pages is simple and direct, with usually six photographs on one page and the corresponding text on the opposite. The commentary by Harris (The Sidewalks of New York) is informative and without jargon, although it tends to editorialize, and there are also occasional editorial errors, such as an apparent difficulty in alphabetizing the Ms in an otherwise useful index.

His primary concern is less with the more intricate formulations of postmodern philosophy than with the culture or milieu of postmodernism as a whole. Above all he speaks to a particular kind of student, or consumer, of popular "brands" of postmodern thought. <br> <p>Although Professor Eagleton's view of the topic is, as he says, generally a negative one, he points to postmodernism's strengths as well as its failings. He sets out not just to expose the illusions of postmodernism but to show the students he has in mind that they never believed what they thought they believed in the first place. In the process his gifts for irony and satire sharpen the reader's pleasure, and his commitment to the ethical and the vision of a just society, inspire engagement and "a refusal to acquiesce in the appalling mess which is the contemporary world".</p><b>Terry Eagleton</b> is Professor of Cultural Theory and John Rylands Fellow at the University of Manchester.

But as she nears thirty, her foothold becomes precarious; a poor girl with expensive tastes, she needs a husband to preserve her social standing and to maintain her in the luxury she has come to expect. Whilst many have sought her, something - fastidiousness or integrity- prevents her from making a 'suitable' match.</p></p><p>"The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth," warns Ecclesiastes 7:4, and so does the novel by Edith Wharton that takes its title from this call to heed. New York at the turn of the century was a time of opulence and frivolity for those who could afford it. But for those who couldn't and yet wanted desperately to keep up with the whirlwind, like Wharton's charming Lily Bart, it was something else altogether: a gilded cage rather than the Gilded Age. <p> One of Wharton's earliest descriptions of her heroine, in the library of her bachelor friend and sometime suitor Lawrence Selden, indicates that she appears "as though she were a captured dryad subdued to the conventions of the drawing room." Indeed, herein lies Lily's problem. She has, we're told, "been brought up to be ornamental," and yet her spirit is larger than what this ancillary role requires. By today's standards she would be nothing more than a mild rebel, but in the era into which Wharton drops her unmercifully, this tiny spark of character, combined with numerous assaults by vicious society women and bad luck, ultimately renders Lily persona non grata. Her own ambivalence about her position serves to open the door to disaster: several times she is on the verge of "good" marriage and squanders it at the last moment, unwilling to play by the rules of a society that produces, as she calls them, "poor, miserable, marriageable girls.</p><p> Lily's rather violent tumble down the social ladder provides a thumbnail sketch of the general injustices of the upper classes (which, incidentally, Wharton never quite manages to condemn entirely, clearly believing that such life is cruel but without alternative). From her start as a beautiful woman at the height of her powers to her sad finale as a recently fired milliner's assistant addicted to sleeping drugs, Lily Bart is heroic, not least for her final admission of her own role in her downfall. "Once--twice--you gave me the chance to escape from my life and I refused it: refused it because I was a coward," she tells Selden as the book draws to a close. All manner of hideous socialite beasts--some of whose treatment by Wharton, such as the token social-climbing Jew, Simon Rosedale, date the book unfortunately--wander through the novel while Lily plummets. As her tale winds down to nothing more than the remnants of social grace and cold hard cash, it's hard not to agree with Lily's own assessment of herself: "I have tried hard--but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person. I can hardly be said to have an independent existence. I was just a screw or a cog in the great machine I called life, and when I dropped out of it I found I was of no use anywhere else." Nevertheless, it's even harder not to believe that she deserved better, which is why <i>The House of Mirth</i> remains so timely and so vital in spite of its crushing end and its unflattering portrait of what life offers up. <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>10 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Optimization in Operations Research</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book is specifically designed to change the way deterministic optimization is taught to introductory students. <b> </b> Toward this end, it exposes students to the broad scope of the topic, reinforces the basic principles, sparks students' enthusiasm about the field, provides tools of immediate relevance and develops the skills necessary to use those tools. </p></p><p></p><h2>Networking with the Affluent</h2><p>The top 1 percent of households in America account for nearly 40 percent of the wealth. This same affluent market is growing seven times faster than the household population in this country Thomas J. Stanley - author of Selling to the Affluent and Marketing to the Affluent - shows that, dollar for dollar, the most productive way to penetrate the affluent market is to network with its members, their advisors, and key members of their important affinity groups. Affluent individuals report that interpersonal, or &#34;word of mouth, &#34; endorsements are the most influential in their decisions to patronize a variety of product and service providers. Networking with the Affluent and Their Advisors offers a proven method for reaching the affluent through their affinity groups and using that association to increase sales, billable hours, and client base. With numerous case examples, Thomas J. Stanley answers several important questions, including: . How did a young sales professional gain the endorsement of a multimillionaire who headed an important trade association? How did an accountant attract hundreds of affluent business owners as clients in spite of never making a single sales call? What commercial organizations can assist the sales professional in setting up an influence network? How did one sales professional propose to meet personally with 100 of the top business owners in his community? What provocative themes were used in two toprated trade journal articles written by extraordinary sales professionals who target the affluent? Imagine the impact on even an ordinary sales professional&#39;s revenue if he were endorsed by the president of a trade association composed of hundreds of millionaires.In fact, this type of endorsement was given at a trade conference. How did this endorsement come about? The dramatic shift in orientation from being an ordinary sales professional to being an extraordinary networker begins with targeting.

The latter novel zeroed in on the town of Gopher Prairie; the former stopped there briefly and then took the reader by automobile in search of America. <i>Free Air</i> heads toward a West that was brimming with possibilities for suddenly mobile Americans at the end of a world war.<p>The vehicle in Lewis&#x2019;s novel, not a Model T but a Gomez-Dep roadster, takes Claire Boltwood and her father from Minnesota to Seattle, exposing them all to the perils of early motoring. On the road, the upper-crust Boltwoods are at once more insignificant and more noble. The greatest distance to be overcome is the social one between Claire and a young mechanic named Milt, who, with a cat as his traveling companion, follows close behind. If <i>Free Air</i> anticipates many of the themes of Lewis&#x2019;s later novels, it also looks forward to a genre that includes John Steinbeck&#x2019;s <i>Travels with Charley and Josh Greenfeld</i> and Paul Mazursky&#x2019;s <i>Harry and Tonto</i>.

Most of the London hanged were executed for property crimes, and the chief lesson that the gallows had to teach was: &#39;Respect private property&#39;. The executions took place amid a London populace that knew the same poverty and hunger as the condemned. Indeed, in this stimulating account Peter Linebaugh shows how there was little distinction between a &#39;criminal&#39; population and the poor population of London as a whole. Necessity drove the city&#39;s poor into inevitable conflict with the laws of a privileged ruling class. Peter Linebaugh examines how the meaning of &#39;property&#39; changed substantially during a century of unparalleled growth in trade and commerce, analyses the increasing attempts of the propertied classes to criminalize &#39;customary rights&#39;--perquisites of employment that the labouring poor depended upon for survival--and suggests that property-owners, by their exploitation of the emergent working class, substantially determined the nature of crime, and that crime, in turn, shaped the development of the economic system. Peter Linebaugh&#39;s account not only pinpoints critical themes in the formation of the working class, but also presents the plight of the individuals who made up that class. Contemporary documents of the period are skilfully used to recreate the predicament of men and women who, in the pursuit of a bare subsistence, had good reason to fear the example of Tyburn&#39;s &#39;triple tree&#39;.</p><p><b>Peter Linebaugh</b> is Professor of History at the University of Toledo. He writes extensively on British history, Irish history, labor history and the history of the colonial Atlantic. His books include <i>The Magna Carta Manifesto</i>, <i>The Many-Headed Hydra</i> and <i>The London Hanged</i>, and he contributes frequently to <i>CounterPunch</i>.In 18th-century Britain, most victims of capital punishment were hanged for property crimes-some as petty as the pilfering of spoons. A brutal and benighted age, we like to think, but to the author of this epic social history (originally published in 1991, it's now in its second edition), the gallows were an indispensable tool in inculcating the primary lesson-"Respect Private Property"-of a modern capitalist economy. Historian Linebaugh, co-author of The Many-Headed Hydra: The Hidden History of the Revolutionary Atlantic, explores how the disruption of a traditional economy of regulated guilds and agricultural commons by a capitalism built on cash wages and competitive markets worked itself out as crime and punishment. Customary forms of payment-in-kind, in which workers took part of the wood they sawed, the silk they wove, or the cargo their ship ferried as wages, were criminalized as theft of the owner's property; capitalists developed new methods of workplace control to circumvent workers' attempts to appropriate the fruits of their labor; and romantic criminal figures like the highwayman expressed working-class resentment at the economic transformations that forced them to steal to live. Linebaugh draws on diverse sources, including judicial archives, family budgets, dietary customs and the writings of Locke and Milton to paint both micro-historical character studies of condemned souls and a panorama of class struggle in proto-industrial Britain. The results are as teeming-and sometimes as confusing-as the London street itself, and the broad Marxian abstractions Linebaugh invokes do not always clarify things. Still, this is a rich and thought-provoking portrait of a time when "class warfare" was an all-too-violent reality.

But to the contrary, <i>Slavery and the Culture of Taste</i> demonstrates that these two areas of modernity were surprisingly entwined. Ranging across Britain, the antebellum South, and the West Indies, and examining vast archives, including portraits, period paintings, personal narratives, and diaries, Simon Gikandi illustrates how the violence and ugliness of enslavement actually shaped theories of taste, notions of beauty, and practices of high culture, and how slavery's impurity informed and haunted the rarified customs of the time.</p><br><p> Gikandi focuses on the ways that the enslavement of Africans and the profits derived from this exploitation enabled the moment of taste in European--mainly British--life, leading to a transformation of bourgeois ideas regarding freedom and selfhood. He explores how these connections played out in the immense fortunes made in the West Indies sugar colonies, supporting the lavish lives of English barons and altering the ideals that defined middle-class subjects. Discussing how the ownership of slaves turned the American planter class into a new aristocracy, Gikandi engages with the slaves' own response to the strange interplay of modern notions of freedom and the realities of bondage, and he emphasizes the aesthetic and cultural processes developed by slaves to create spaces of freedom outside the regimen of enforced labor and truncated leisure.</p><br><p> Through a close look at the eighteenth century's many remarkable documents and artworks, <i>Slavery and the Culture of Taste</i> sets forth the tensions and contradictions entangling a brutal practice and the distinctions of civility.</p></p><p><p>"It is difficult to think of a single work that more clearly and carefully reveals the inextricable intertwining of the habits and social practices of the British elite in the drawing rooms of London with the harsh brutalities of Britain's central involvement in the creation and maintenance of the slave trade in the West Indies and West Africa. This book is full of stunning insights and is a pleasure to read. It is an original contribution to the study of the Enlightenment."<b>--Henry Louis Gates, Jr., author of <i>Tradition and the Black Atlantic</i> and <i>The Trials of Phillis Wheatley</i></b></p><p>"This ambitious, intelligent, and far-reaching book argues that selfhood and the culture of taste were constituted by slavery. It is, as far as I know, the first in-depth look at slave performance in relation to the British culture of taste and refinement, and will, without a doubt, transform our understanding of the eighteenth century."<b>--Saidiya Hartman, author of <i>Lose Your Mother: A Journey Along the Atlantic Slave Route</i></b></p><p>"This book cogently argues for the complexities between the cultures of politeness in eighteenth-century English culture and the practices of slave capitalism. Connecting images of slavery with archival sources from the eighteenth century as well as with the writings of modern and contemporary theorists and philosophers, Gikandi's work will interest scholars of eighteenth-century studies, the Black Atlantic, British cultural and literary history, and colonial/postcolonial studies, as well as historians of slavery and the slave trade."<b>--Philip Gould, Brown University</b></p><p>"This book explores with great insight the relations between taste--a social, aesthetic, and regulatory standard, crafted by traditional elites--and the practices of violence and exploitation that characterized slavery in the eighteenth century.

It revolves around the premise that beginners' main interests center on developing the ability to draw what they see or envision in a more or less objective manner. <b> </b> The book approaches the teaching of drawing in the same way artists approach the creating of drawings: by proceeding from the general to the specific, acknowledging the given conditions of visual expression, being consistent and clear, and presenting a work in an organized and economical manner. Chapter titles include Matters of Measurement, From Gesture to Line, From Line to Shape, From Shape to Plane and Structure, From Structure to Value and Volume, Color in Drawing, Composition in Drawing, Seeing with the Mind's Eye, and Materials of Drawing. <b> </b> For serious amateur artists. </p></p><p><p> <i>Drawing to See</i> is specifically designed for the beginning drawing student. The focus of this clear and thorough text is to teach students what they need to know and see to draw in an objective manner. It introduces students to the concepts and procedures necessary to develop sound drawing skills, focusing on matters of measurement and perspective, line and shape, planar and structural analysis, value and volume, and color. The book then explores the compositional and expressive aspects of both observational and imaginative drawing. Authors <b>Nathan Goldstein and Harriet Fishman</b> have carefully selected the best examples available to illustrate their points, choosing a broad range of images from simple line art to old masters to contemporary artists. </p> <b>Features of this new text include:</b> <ul> <li> <b>A practical introduction</b> that addresses the book's rationale, themes, and content.</li> <li> <b> <i>Things to Think About</i></b><i> </i> sections help students thoroughly understand the main points of each chapter.</li> <li> <b> <i>Critical Considerations</i></b><i> </i> sections anticipate common drawing problems having to do with perception, response, execution, composition, and other important drawing issues. These sections introduce beginning students to the kinds of observations and queries generally made by teachers in classroom critique situations.</li> <li> <b>Drawing exercises</b> appear in eight of the nine chapters, giving students the opportunity to practice the concepts they have learned.</li> </ul><p> Among the earliest traces of our common ancestry are cave drawings and paintings of plants, birds, hands, people, animals, and even hunting scenes. Although we can't really know what motivated these remarkable images (magic? score-keeping? amusement?), it seems that making visual images has been necessary to humankind, almost from the start, for many kinds of clarifying, recording, and expressive reasons. </p> <p> As you embark on the study of drawing, it is important to recognize that, to this day, drawing is still a direct (and enchanting) way to clarify, to record, and to express. Indeed, drawing well is mostly about doing these three things in a resolute and appealing way. No matter what your ultimate goal for drawing may be, you will always be trying to communicate your ideas and experiences clearly. </p> <p> There are many reasons and ways to draw. A drawing may be motivated by a wish to study a form's appearance, or to plan a creative work in another medium. A drawing may serve to show a client what you intend to create, or to explore the images of your imagination in order to see what they may look like and where they may take you. Many drawings are motivated by a wish to experience the visual and expressive character of something that is seen or recalled&#x2014;the places, things, and people in the world around you. </p> <p> But whatever stimulates you to draw, the "ticket of admission" into the great realm of drawing is the ability to see a subject's parts <i>in a relational way,</i> that is, to see the similarities and differences among a subject's many features and conditions. For example, if your subject is your own hand, opened before you, palm side up, with your extended fingers spread, the middle finger is longest, but by how much when compared to the ring finger? to the little finger? And is the little finger shorter or longer than the thumb? Looking at the spaces separating the fingers, which space is the widest and which, the narrowest? And, although the four fingers are similar in their shape, what differences do you see in their contours? Where are the lightest tones on your hand, and where are the darkest ones? Among the hand's many folds and creases, which are the most pronounced? </p> <p> These are only some of the questions you need to answer in order to drat the unique nature of your hand in an objectively truthful way. Learning how to draA begins with, and is nourished by, learning how to see, and learning how to see begins with recognizing that inquiries about relationships of size, shape, value, position, and more, must lead the way. It is the inability to see such relationships that stands squarely in the way of learning to draw. Although your eventual creative expressions may take you far from drawing in an objective mode, reaching these goals cannot benefit from a functional blindness to the relational matters fundamental to drawing. </p> <p> The authors of this book, having taught drawing for many years, have repeatedly seen the often rapid development in drawing skills among those studentartists who approach the learning of drawing in an inquiring, and not in an arbitrary or declarative, way. Such students soon realize that sensitively relating a subject's parts and its underlying patterns, when comparing, measuring, and choosing, is a vital key to creating drawings, in any mode, that ring true and come alive. </p> <p> With that in mind, the authors felt that starting this study of drawing with an introduction to a wide range of relational matters (Chapter One) will alert you to more of them than you would otherwise be likely to see and consider. The advantage of beginning in this way is important because seeing more of what is there to compare and relate means you have more control of what you draw at every stage of your studies&#x2014;the more we see the better we draw. For example, reading Chapter One's discussion on seeing directions&#x2014;the tilts and turnings of a subject's parts&#x2014;in alerting you to where and how these directions show themselves&#x2014;will help you to better draw the main topic of Chapter Two: a subject's <i>gesture.</i> </p> <p> The authors further felt that, just as a drawing is invariably created by a process which moves from the general to the specific, the teaching of drawing can also begin (more or less) with a concentration on the most encompassing matters of drawing before turning to more particular ones. That is why, once you have been alerted to what measurable matters to look for in a subject, we have presented the concept of gesture as the most pervasive feature of anything you set out to draw. This is so because everything has gesture, has some enveloping pattern of action and energy that underlies its form, be it the human figure, an eyelid, a staircase, or a sparrow. </p> <p> And, just as Chapter Two ends with an approach to the visual element of <i>line,</i> (for the underlying matter of gesture soon rises to the surface where lines are a direct and efficient means of proceeding further), Chapter Three begins with line, exploring its several guises and functions, and ends by approaching the next logical matter: <i>shape.</i> Proceeding on our journey from the general to the specific, Chapter Four examines the several roles of the element of shape in drawing, especially shape's role in forming a volume's surface facets, or planes. And planes, when they get together, produce a form's <i>surface structure,</i> a major focus of Chapter Five, which then goes on to explore two more visual elements: <i>value</i> and <i>volume.</i> </p> <p> Chapter Six examines some issues in drawings that use the element of <i>color,</i> perhaps the most mysterious of the visual elements, and the most powerful too, as it modifies all the other elements. Chapter Seven and Chapter Eight depart from our general approach and move toward to specific approaches, as each chapter concentrates on ever-present matters fundamental to drawing. Chapter Seven takes on the illusive but crucial matter of <i>composition,</i> and shows that the successful communication of your creative meanings owes much to the underlying dynamic forces alive in the things you draw. Up to this point the book has concentrated on how to better draw the things you actually see. Chapter Eight considers how to respond to subjects that you don't actually see: those of <i>recall</i> and <i>imagination.</i> All of the preceding chapters will have prepared you for encountering and capturing these more personal and often fleeting visions. Chapter Nine concerns the materials and tools of drawing, an important subject because of their influence on the images you will make. Lastly, we have included a glossary of terms as used in this book, to help you get the most out of each discussion. </p> <p> Put simply, learning to draw means doing a lot of it as you take on the many challenges of relational seeing. One of the most useful tools for enabling you to draw anywhere and at any time is the sketchbook, an invaluable learning device that students and artists have used for several hundred years. There are many kinds and sizes of sketchbook. The authors suggest selecting one that can be easily carried around. A sketchbook that measures approximately 8.5 by 11 inches is just about right. </p> <p> In the relative privacy of a sketchbook you are more likely to "take chances," to more bravely risk losing a drawing that tries to reach for an idea, a procedure, or a subject that, earlier on, was too difficult to manage. Think of your sketchbook as a private journal or sanctuary, not available for others to browse without your permission. It also helps to think of it as a kind of gym, a place where you go to visually "work out." And, as in a gym environment, where a failed attempt is simply dismissed and tried again (and again), a sketchbook drawing that doesn't succeed should likewise be dismissed and tried again, and not be seen as an unmovable limit of your ability to draw. </p> <p> To continue the analogy, as with your physical limits in the gym, where you can jump only so far or lift only so much, learning <i>how</i> to jump farther or <i>how</i> to lift more will, in time, get results. It is the same with drawing. Learning <i>how</i> to see more will, in time, result in drawings that succeed in saying better what you mean them to say. The sketchbook helps to speed up the process of seeing, because many sketchbook drawings are likely to be of short duration&#x2014;a condition that encourages artists to see in a more selective and relational way&#x2014;the better to recall the subject, which may have moved on. This practice makes for better observation and more resolute results. </p> <p> The advantages of the sketchbook for practice, investigation, planning, anq the recording of subjects you would otherwise not encounter are too important tb bypass. Browsing this book's reproductions of old and contemporary master drawings will show how many of these works are, if not actually sketchbook drawings, in the investigative spirit of sketchbook drawings. </p> <p> A word about the drawings that appear in the book is in order here. The authors felt that showing you the most outstanding examples of maters referred to in the text far outweighed all other considerations. The idea of insisting on a policy that would all but exclude either contemporary artists or old masters in making our selections seemed unnecessarily restricting as extraordinary drawings are to be had from each era. Instead, we searched for works that most clearly demonstrated the various points in each chapter with little regard for when or where a work was created. </p> <p> Another matter to think about as you embark on the study of drawing is the evaluation of your efforts by others. Art students, like professional artists, will have their works judged now and then. The famous art school "critique" of student work is one example of this, the opinions of friends and family, are another. Although such evaluations can be valuable to the development of your drawing skills, it is usually difficult to hear that your judgments or manner of drawing are regarded as faulty in some way: It may be of some help to recognize that there are, broadly speaking, two categories of criticism: those having to do with provable fact, and those with opinion. Teachers of basic drawing will generally emphasize the former: "the legs are too short for the rest of the body," or "the perspective of the table is off," or "the volume of this form isn't clear to me." Such criticisms, being plainly factual, can be readily accepted. Criticisms having to do with opinion may also be valuable, but these often have as their basis certain artistic beliefs or other values of importance to the critic that he or she hopes you will consider. When, in the opinion of an art teacher, your drawing is regarded as "too tight," "too carelessly observed," "too concerned with surface effects," or "unbalanced on the page," you are probably getting good advice. But when a relative or a friend suggests your drawings should be "prettier," "less messy," or "not so sad," you can safely disregard the criticism, however well meant it may be. Criticism is best sorted out by having in mind the goals you hold for yourself. </p> <p> As you read (and draw!) your way through this book (ideally while enrolled in a drawing course), remember that you are probably a good judge of your progress in developing your drawing skills, in the light of where you wish to go. But so too, are the artist-teachers who are helping you by alerting you to possibilities, problems, and challenges you need to confront to reach your goals. They can help you work through obstacles and achieve results. The authors hope this book will also help you in that important way. </p></p><h2>In Defense of the Bible: A Comprehensive Apologetic for the Authority of Scripture</h2><p><i>In Defense of the Bible </i>gathers exceptional articles by accomplished scholars (Paul Copan, William A.

Maurie D. McInnis explores the social, political, and material culture of the city to learn how--and at what human cost--Charleston came to be regarded as one of the most refined cities in antebellum America.<br><br>While other cities embraced a culture of democracy and egalitarianism, wealthy Charlestonians cherished English notions of aristocracy and refinement, defending slavery as a social good and encouraging the growth of southern nationalism. Members of the city's merchant-planter class held tight to the belief that the clothes they wore, the manners they adopted, and the ways they designed house lots and laid out city streets helped secure their place in social hierarchies of class and race. This pursuit of refinement, McInnis demonstrates, was bound up with their determined efforts to control the city's African American majority. She then examines slave dress, mobility, work spaces, and leisure activities to understand how Charleston slaves negotiated their lives among the whites they served. <br><br>The textures of lives lived in houses, yards, streets, and public spaces come into dramatic focus in this lavishly illustrated portrait of antebellum Charleston. McInnis's innovative history of the city combines the aspirations of its would-be nobility, the labors of the African slaves who built and tended the town, and the ambitions of its architects, painters, writers, and civic promoters.<br><br></p><p>"Interesting, compelling, and insightful."-- <i>Arris</i> <br>This richly illustrated volume examines Charleston&#39;s social and political culture as revealed in its material culture--dress, art, household goods, and architecture--when the city was the wealthiest in the new nation.</p><h2>A Field Guide to Pacific States Wildflowers (The Peterson Field Guide Series 22)</h2><p>12mo, PP.432, Stock Photo May Be Incorrect</p><p>Roger Tory Peterson, one of the world&#39;s greatest naturalists, received every major award for ornithology, natural science, and conservation, as well as numerous honorary degrees, medals, and citations, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

From the steel foundry to the burger-grill, from Woodrow Wilson to John Sweeney, from Homestead to Pittston, Lichtenstein weaves together a compelling matrix of ideas, stories, strikes, laws, and people in a streamlined narrative of work and labor in the twentieth century.</p><br><p> The "labor question" became a burning issue during the Progressive Era because its solution seemed essential to the survival of American democracy itself. Beginning there, Lichtenstein takes us all the way to the organizing fever of contemporary Los Angeles, where the labor movement stands at the center of the effort to transform millions of new immigrants into alert citizen unionists. He offers an expansive survey of labor's upsurge during the 1930s, when the New Deal put a white, male version of industrial democracy at the heart of U.S. political culture. He debunks the myth of a postwar "management-labor accord" by showing that there was (at most) a limited, unstable truce.</p><br><p> Lichtenstein argues that the ideas that had once sustained solidarity and citizenship in the world of work underwent a radical transformation when the rights-centered social movements of the 1960s and 1970s captured the nation's moral imagination. The labor movement was therefore tragically unprepared for the years of Reagan and Clinton: although technological change and a new era of global economics battered the unions, their real failure was one of ideas and political will. Throughout, Lichtenstein argues that labor's most important function, in theory if not always in practice, has been the vitalization of a democratic ethos, at work and in the larger society. To the extent that the unions fuse their purpose with that impulse, they can once again become central to the fate of the republic. <i>State of the Union</i> is an incisive history that tells the story of one of America's defining aspirations.</p><br><p> This edition includes a new preface in which Lichtenstein engages with many of those who have offered commentary on <i>State of the Union</i> and evaluates the historical literature that has emerged in the decade since the book's initial publication. He also brings his narrative into the current moment with a final chapter, "Obama's America: Liberalism without Unions.?</p></p><p><p>"Scholars have come to look to Nelson Lichtenstein for state-of-the-art work on American labor history. Now he has synthesized his immense learning into a powerful narrative of the ups and downs of unions since the New Deal. Elegiac, sympathetic, and keenly realistic, <i>State of the Union</i> focuses, above all, on the role of ideas and ideology in shaping contentious outcomes. The writing is engaged, analytically suggestive, and thoughtfully revisionist. Not just students of trade unions, but historians of the moments and episodes Lichtenstein chronicles, will be wrestling with this fascinating book for a long time to come."<b>--Ira Katznelson, Ruggles Professor of Political Science and History, Columbia University</b></p><p>"This is a brilliant work of historical synthesis and interpretation. No other historian has produced a narrative that cogently surveys intellectual developments, economic change, political and legal conflict, and the complexities of labor's internal struggles and weaves them into a compelling narrative that makes sense of the rise and fall of the working-class movement."<b>--Michael Kazin, Professor of History, Georgetown University</b></p><p>"Lichtenstein's textured account offers an impressive combination of astute historical analysis and keen social insight. Lichtenstein demonstrates how, despite its civil rights origins, the 'rights revolution' of the past generation has joined free-market ideology in undermining the legal and social basis for worker solidarity and union success. Greater individual freedoms have ironically not always helped the working people of America."<b>--David Abraham, Professor of Law, University of Miami Law School</b></p><p>"Nelson Lichtenstein, one of our leading historians, follows the movement for democracy and rights at work over the last hundred years, offering a masterful synthesis of the new labor history and the first comprehensive framework for a history of labor in our time."<b>--Dorothy Sue Cobble, Professor of Labor Studies, Rutgers University</b></p><p>"<i>State of the Union</i> is a uniquely important study of the labor movement in twentieth-century American politics. Lichtenstein demonstrates both an intricate, grounded knowledge of union dynamics and a finely nuanced, sophisticated understanding of American political history since the New Deal. This book is a must read for anyone seriously interested in making sense of American politics during the last three-quarters of a century."<b>--Adolph Reed, Professor of Political Science on the Graduate Faculty of Political and Social Science, New School University, and member of the Interim National Council of the Labor Party</b></p><p>"You can find no better guide to the past and present of the American labor movement than Nelson Lichtenstein. Aimed at a general audience, this book shows how the health of American democracy depends on vital working-class organizations. It examines why unions have flourished in the past and asks how they may do so again."<b>--William Forbath, Professor of Law and History, University of Texas, Austin, and author of <i>Law and the Shaping of the American Labor Movement</i></b></p><p>"Why has the labor movement's ability to speak collectively on behalf of American workers declined so dramatically? Ranging confidently across political, intellectual, social, and economic history, Nelson Lichtenstein gives us a sweeping and provocative analysis of the 'labor question' in the past fifty years--and how workers' basic democratic rights have been increasingly marginalized, contained, or eliminated. He eloquently reminds us that if we are to have democracy in America, we must celebrate, not repress, basic human rights at the workplace."<b>--Dana Frank, Professor of American Studies, University of California, Santa Cruz</b></p><b>Nelson Lichtenstein</b> is Professor of History at the University of California, Santa Barbara. He was the 2012 recipient of the Sol Stetin Award in Labor History and is the author of twelve books, including <i>Walter Reuther: The Most Dangerous Man in Detroit</i>, <i>Labor's War at Home</i>, and <i>The Retail Revolution: How Wal-Mart Created a Brave New World of Business</i>.</p><h2>Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas</h2><p><p>Few Americans identify slavery with the cultivation of rice, yet rice was a major plantation crop during the first three centuries of settlement in the Americas. Rice accompanied African slaves across the Middle Passage throughout the New World to Brazil, the Caribbean, and the southern United States. By the middle of the eighteenth century, rice plantations in South Carolina and the black slaves who worked them had created one of the most profitable economies in the world.</p><p><i>Black Rice</i> tells the story of the true provenance of rice in the Americas. It establishes, through agricultural and historical evidence, the vital significance of rice in West African society for a millennium before Europeans arrived and the slave trade began. The standard belief that Europeans introduced rice to West Africa and then brought the knowledge of its cultivation to the Americas is a fundamental fallacy, one which succeeds in effacing the origins of the crop and the role of Africans and African-American slaves in transferring the seed, the cultivation skills, and the cultural practices necessary for establishing it in the New World. </p><p>In this vivid interpretation of rice and slaves in the Atlantic world, Judith Carney reveals how racism has shaped our historical memory and neglected this critical African contribution to the making of the Americas.</p></p><p>Judith A.

In the nineteenth century, Corning developed colored signal lights for railroads. In the twentieth century, it created Pyrex and color television tubes; today, it is a Fortune 500 company leading the international marketplace in areas such as fiber optics and photonics.<br> If you use the Internet, drive a car, or simply turn on a light, then Corning is a part of your life. <em>The Generations of Corning</em> tells the fascinating stories of its founding family--the Houghtons, the inventors, and the adventures, behind Corning's remarkable achievements--from unexpected discoveries, like the laboratory mishap that led to Corning Ware, to the years of painstaking, often frustrating, research that led to its breakthrough in fiber optics.<br> From 1851 to 1996, five generations of Houghtons made Corning a company that combined a culture of continuous innovation with a sense of loyalty to its employees and their community. Davis Dyer and Daniel Gross show how the critical changes in organization and leadership that accompanied each new generation helped Corning not just survive, but to prosper, and push itself to the cutting edge of materials technology in decade after decade. <em>The Generations of Corning</em> is a classic success story and a triumph of the inventive spirit.<br></p><p><br><strong>Davis Dyer</strong> is Founding Director of The Winthrop Group. <strong>Daniel Gross</strong> is a Business Writer and Associate of The Winthrop Group.<br>These two books, along with a third volume (the forthcoming Corning Through the Ages), were commissioned by Corning to mark 150 years in business. While such an endeavor is inevitably self-serving, the authors have been allowed to present both the accomplishments (and they are numerous) and the sticking points and warts. In The Generations of Corning, Dyer and Gross detail the history of the organization from its inception to the current day. From a business perspective, it is intriguing to learn how a company was able to take a fundamental material glass and both develop its particular formulation and engineer the industrial process to expedite manufacturing. This was true for the electric light bulb, fiber optics, and a host of other industrial and consumer products. The history also shows how Corning leveraged its competencies through large-scale partnerships. In Corning and the Craft of Innovation, history is subjugated to more specific topics. Hence, Gross and Shuldiner deal with glassmaking as both an art and a science, the realm of processes, and military applications. Perhaps the greatest value of the book is in showing how Corning came to embody what in today's jargon is a "learning organization." As a result, an organization that made its living off the mundane (e.g., the light bulb) was able to create the spectacular (e.g., the 200" telescope mirror). While each work covers much the same material, the scientist may prefer Craft and the social economist, Generations; both books are recommended.

This book offers an authoritative and comprehensive account of the bicycle's technical and historical evolution, from the earliest velocipedes (invented to fill the need for horseless transport during a shortage of oats) to modern racing bikes, mountain bikes, and recumbents. It traces the bicycle's development in terms of materials, ergonomics, and vehicle physics, as carried out by inventors, entrepreneurs, and manufacturers.</p><p>Written by two leading bicycle historians and generously illustrated with historic drawings, designs, and photographs, <i>Bicycle Design</i> describes the key stages in the evolution of the bicycle, beginning with the counterintuitive idea of balancing on two wheels in line, through the development of tension-spoked wheels, indirect drives (employing levers, pulleys, chains, and chainwheels), and pneumatic tires. The authors examine the further development of the bicycle for such specific purposes as racing, portability, and all-terrain use; and they describe the evolution of bicycle components including seats, transmission, brakes, lights (at first candle-based), and carriers (racks, panniers, saddlebags, child seats, and sidecars). They consider not only commercially successful designs but also commercial failures that pointed the way to future technological developments. And they debunk some myths about bicycles&#x2015;for example, the mistaken but often-cited idea that Leonardo sketched a chain-drive bike in his notebooks.</p><p>Despite the bicycle's long history and mass appeal, its technological history has been neglected. This volume, with its engaging and wide-ranging coverage, fills that gap. It will be the starting point for all future histories of the bicycle.</p></p><p>Tony Hadland is the author of <i>Raleigh: Past and Presence of an Iconic Bicycle Brand</i> and other books.<p>... a winning tour of bike design.</p>&#x2015;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i><br><br><p>... visually engaging.</p>&#x2015;<i>The Los Angeles Times</i><br><br><p>... definitive book on the subject.</p>&#x2015;<i>London Review of Books</i><br><br><p><i>Bicycle Design</i> is the authoritative one-volume reference on cycling history and cannot be recommended highly enough.</p>&#x2015;<b>Carlton Reid</b>, <i>BikeBiz</i><br><br><p>Destined to become the definitive record of our wonderful wheels.</p>&#x2015;<b>Mike Burrows</b>, <i>Cycle</i></p><h2>Art and Architecture in France, 1500-1700: Fourth Edition (The Yale University Press Pelican Histor)</h2><p>A study of the art and architecture of France in the 16th and 17th centuries - an epoch of superb secular building which also produced many notable paintings and sculptures.</p><p></p><h2>Modern Food Service Purchasing: Business Essentials to Procurement</h2><p>MODERN FOOD SERVICE PURCHASING is designed specifically to provide culinary arts professionals with current, in-depth coverage of the essential concepts of purchasing, storeroom operations, and financial stewardship.

The two final essays contain further reflections on the Mexican government.</p><p>First published in 1950, <i>The Labyrinth of Solitude</i> addresses issues that are both seemingly eternal and resoundingly contemporary: the nature of political power in post-conquest Mexico, the relation of Native Americans to Europeans, the ubiquity of official corruption. Noting these matters earned Paz no small amount of trouble from the Mexican leadership, but it also brought him renown as a social critic. Paz, who went on to win the Nobel Prize for Literature, later voiced his disillusionment with all political systems--as the Mexican proverb has it, "all revolutions degenerate into governments"--but his call for democracy in this book has lately been reverberating throughout Mexico, making it timely once again.Octavio Paz was born in Mexico City in 1914 to a family of Spanish and native Mexican descent. He was the author of more than twenty-five books of poetry and prose. In addition to being a poet, essayist, playwright, social philosopher, and critic, he also served as a Mexican diplomat in France and Japan, and as ambassador to India. He was awarded the Cervantes Award in 1981, the Neustadt Prize in 1982, and the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1990. Octavio Paz died in 1998.</p><h2>Carl Pops Up</h2><p>Carl and the baby embark on an adventure when Madeline&#39;s mother leaves the loveable rottweiler in charge while she is gone for a while</p><p>Fans of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> know that when Mom says, "Look after the baby, Carl. I'll be back shortly," the excitement is about to begin, and this pop-up book is no exception. As soon as she's out the door, baby and dog are off on a wild afternoon filled with adventure. The first of many interactive pull-tabs has baby climbing out of his crib and onto Carl's back, which is like the bells ringing the start of a horse race--they're out of the gate and it's full speed ahead. Down the laundry chute, into the aquarium, and off to lunch--chocolate milk (heavy on the chocolate), cookies, and a little "butter" sandwich. Kids are sure to get a kick out of the miniature cuckoo that jumps from the clock, announcing cleanup time. As usual, Carl manages to erase all evidence of mischief and has the baby back in its crib when Mom walks through the door. With pull-tabs and pop-ups on every page, this book is sure to keep young "readers" as busy as Carl and the baby. <i>--Colleen Preston</i>Day gives Carl's many fans the chance to interact with the famous canine baby-sitter in this humorously understated pop-up. The rottweiler, the baby he cares for and selected objects inventively spring from the pages and-with the help of pull-tabs-move in a variety of entertaining ways. Upon opening the cover, which features a die-cut window, the reader is welcomed by a happy baby and an attentive, eager Carl-both of whom rise up from the title page. The two bounce on a bed, dress up comically and view themselves in an acetate mirror, and make a glorious mess having a snack. Under Carl's careful watch, baby has a swim in the aquarium and-in one of the book's most engaging uses of pull-tabs-jumps down the laundry chute and lands on top of a basket of clothes in the basement. After the child has a bath and is put down for a nap, the diligent dog cleans up in time for the return of mother, who greets him with the familiar "Good Dog, Carl!" Several of the coated pages in this paper-over-board volume fold out, adding extra dimension to a winsome addition to the Carl collection.

This brilliant translation of <i>Fibrils</i>, the third volume of his monumental autobiographical project <i>The </i><i>Rules of the Game</i>, invites us to discover why L�vi-Strauss proclaimed him &#x201c;incontestably one of the greatest writers of the century.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Leiris&#x2019;s autobiographical essay, a thirty-five-year project, is a primary document of the examined life in the twentieth century. In <i>Fibrils</i>, Leiris reconciles literary commitment with social/political engagement. He recounts extensive travel and anthropological work, including a 1955 visit to Mao&#x2019;s China. He also details his suicidal &#x201c;descent into Hell,&#x201d; when the guilt over an extramarital affair becomes unbearable. A ruthless self-examiner, Leiris seeks to invent a new way of remembering, probe the mechanisms of memory and explore the way a life can be told.</p><p><b>Michel Leiris</b> (1901&#x2013;1990) was a profoundly influential and versatile French intellectual and the author of <i>Manhood</i> and <i>Phantom Africa</i>. His four-volume autobiographical essay, <i>The Rules of the Game</i>, serves as a primary document of artistic life in the twentieth century. <b>Lydia Davis</b> has received numerous awards as a translator of works from the French and as the author of the best-selling fiction collections <i>Collected Stories</i> and <i>Can&#x2019;t and Won&#x2019;t</i>.&#x201c;A multivolume memoir that is thoroughly Proustian . . . beautifully translated from the French by Lydia Davis . . . Like Proust, Leiris is for readers with patience and a love for language . . . Leiris&#x2019;s subject is not simply himself, or his thoughts and feelings and actions, but writing itself.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jon M. Sweeney, <i>America</i><br>&#x201c;[A] magnificent English translation by Lydia Davis . . . Before Elena Ferrante, before Karl Ove Knausgaard, before the contemporary flourishing of autobiographical narrative, there was Michel Leiris&#x2019;s memoir . . . Like watching an acrobat, the reader marvels at Leiris&#x2019;s narrator moving, now slowly, now swiftly, through a series of sinuous loops, curls, and excursions.&#x201d;&#x2014;Tim Watson, <i>Public Books</i><br>"There is no better translator than Lydia Davis, who has not only rendered in its necessarily complex light this infinitely important text of autobiographical-reflective thoughts and counterthoughts, but provided a sumptuous and clarifying introduction to its elegant author.&#x2014;Mary Ann Caws, editor of the <i>Yale Anthology of Twentieth-Century French Poetry</i><br>"<i>Fibrilles</i>, the French title of volume three of Leiris&#x2019;s autobiographical masterwork, <i>The Rules of the Game</i>, has exactly the same connotations as its English cognate, <i>Fibrils</i>: small fibers or, in botany, the ultimate subdivisions of a plant root&#x2014;which Leiris here punningly entwines with all the &#x201c;febrile&#x201d; filaments of terror or hallucination that striate the natural history of his mind.&nbsp; Throughout her translation, Lydia Davis pays minute attention to the adventitious rhizomes of Leiris&#x2019;s sentences, which move forward by ever moving laterally, disclosing the self by an endless process of subterranean deferral. Davis has now been transplanting Leiris into English for a quarter of a century: her craft as a translator shows in her own writing, as it does here on every page."&#x2014;Richard Sieburth<br>After an official voyage in Communist China, Michel Leiris, an ethnographer and an autobiographer, started this third installment of his autobiographical endeavor with the intent of exploring the common roots of his life long passion for travel and his desire to be a poet. In the midst of the story of his journeys, the narration is interrupted by a failed suicide attempt which is followed by a week long coma and months of rehabilitation that provide him with another experience of voyage, this time in a kind of hoffmanesque nether world where the now dead theatrical and operatic figures that haunted his childhood come to revisit him. Never autobiography has been as close to music than in this opera buffa like complaint of a sixty years old insecure Cherubino who, in spite of having long crossed the gates of manhood, is still asking around: "Voi che sapete che cosa e l&#x2019;amor."&#x2014;Denis Hollier, New York University<br></p><h2>The Elements of Style: Classic Edition (2018): With Editor's Notes, New Chapters &amp; Study Guide</h2><p><p>This updated 2018 Classic Edition contains the original version of William Strunk's <em>The Elements of Style,</em> plus a variety of enhancements that make this book even more useful.

Newly arrived in Berlin, Franz soon repays his uncle's condescension in his aunt's bed.</p><p>Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov was born on April 23, 1899, in St. Petersburg, Russia. The Nabokovs were known for their high culture and commitment to public service, and the elder Nabokov was an outspoken opponent of antisemitism and one of the leaders of the opposition party, the Kadets. In 1919, following the Bolshevik revolution, he took his family into exile. Four years later he was shot and killed at a political rally in Berlin while trying to shield the speaker from right-wing assassins. <br><br>The Nabokov household was trilingual, and as a child Nabokov was already reading Wells, Poe, Browning, Keats, Flaubert, Verlaine, Rimbaud, Tolstoy, and Chekhov, alongside the popular entertainments of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Jules Verne. As a young man, he studied Slavic and romance languages at Trinity College, Cambridge, taking his honors degree in 1922. For the next eighteen years he lived in Berlin and Paris, writing prolifically in Russian under the pseudonym Sirin and supporting himself through translations, lessons in English and tennis, and by composing the first crossword puzzles in Russian. In 1925 he married Vera Slonim, with whom he had one child, a son, Dmitri. <br><br>Having already fled Russia and Germany, Nabokov became a refugee once more in 1940, when he was forced to leave France for the United States. There he taught at Wellesley, Harvard, and Cornell. He also gave up writing in Russian and began composing fiction in English. In his afterword to <b>Lolita</b> he claimed: "My private tragedy, which cannot, and indeed should not, be anybody's concern, is that I had to abandon my natural idiom, my untrammeled, rich, and infinitely docile Russian tongue for a second-rate brand of English, devoid of any of those apparatuses--the baffling mirror, the black velvet backdrop, the implied associations and traditions--which the native illusionist, frac-tails flying, can magically use to transcend the heritage in his own way." [p. 317] Yet Nabokov's American period saw the creation of what are arguably his greatest works, <b>Bend Sinister</b> (1947), <b>Lolita</b> (1955), <b>Pnin</b> (1957), and <b>Pale Fire</b> (1962), as well as the translation of his earlier Russian novels into English. He also undertook English translations of works by Lermontov and Pushkin and wrote several books of criticism. Vladimir Nabokov died in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1977.When the na�ve, provincial Franz becomes entangled in an affair with his uncle&#39;s wife, Martha Dreyer, he finds himself caught in a dangerous love triangle. As Martha becomes more intent on murdering her husband, she enslaves Franz in her diabolical plan. But the lovers find that the perfect plot for murder leads to numerous complexities. Christopher Lane&#39;s narration is utterly mesmerizing. His deep voice and measured pace capture the ominous undertones that Nabokov supplies throughout the novel. Without missing a beat, Lane&#39;s vocal characterizations are wonderfully diverse. He conveys the sensual and malicious nature of Nabokov&#39;s vicious femme fatale as flawlessly as he stammers the thoughts of the bumbling Franz. With his fluid and compelling performance, Lane&#39;s delivery of this tantalizing novel resonates with richness.

This unprecedented analysis explores the history and strategies that created a truly triumphant brand.</strong><br><br><em>Pan Am: History, Design &amp; Identity</em>is an inspired tribute to one of the most influential companies of the 20th century and a superbly told cultural history of American modernism. It is the captivating story of an airline company that refused to consider anything impossible and single-handedly revolutionized air travel. From modest beginnings in the late 1920's, Pan Am developed into the world's best known airline with astonishing speed. Its rapid rise was accompanied by highly effective publicity campaigns which featured some of the best design and advertising in the industry. Pan Am plays a significant role in American popular culture and many of its iconic designs have remained in our collective memory down to the present day. <br><br>The book takes the reader on a journey into the daring world of early air travel, follows the first crossings of the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, investigates commercial aviation during World War II, and gives a feeling of the thrill of the jet age when a plane ticket started to become more affordable for the general public and mass tourism took off. A spellbinding visual storyline featuring more than 900 photos and illustrations supplements the meticulously researched text, allowing readers to retrace for themselves Pan Am's resourceful marketing and design initiatives. <br><br>No expense has been spared to reproduce this critical part of American cultural history: Many museums and private collectors cooperated and Callisto's production manager supervised the digitalization and recorded the properties of much of the original commercial art reproduced in this book, taking note of any special colors or other significant characteristics. To enable the reader to enjoy them with the same intensity Pan Am's customers did many years ago, the Collector's Limited Edition features additional varnishes and Pantone colors to simulate originals as closely as feasible. The result is a book that presents all commercial art with unparalleled accuracy and vivacity. <br><br>Conceived by internationally recognized art book publisher Callisto and designed by distinguished Berlin-based designer Yvonne Quirmbach, <em>Pan Am: History, Design &amp; Identity</em> was produced in a renowned printing facility in northern Italy on deluxe 200 g Fedrigoni paper. <br><br>The Premium Edition is also available as a Collector's Limited Edition presented in a grand clamshell case designed by Yvonne Quirmbach, with a cover made from blue acrylic glass reminiscent of the airline's branding. (See ISBN 9783981655056.)</p><p>Matthias C. H�hne: the author is a property developer and owner of Callisto Publishers.

So far, Huhne&#39;s books have received numerous glowing reviews in leading media around the world."The best book ever written on any airline - Pan Am or otherwise." (Jeff Kriendler, Former Pan Am vice president for corporate communications)<br><br>"Pan Am's soaring brand image comes alive" (<i>Adweek</i>)<br><br>"This book belongs on every travel lover's shelf" (<i>USA Today</i>)<br><br>"High-Flying Design" (Steven Heller)<br><br>"What a book!

The show&#39;s next venue is the National Gallery, London. As this book and the landmark exhibition demonstrate, El Greco is of perennial interest to museum audiences and the general public. He was a fascinating and esteemed artist in his own time, but for nearly four hundred years he was derided, misunderstood, or simply forgotten. The book follows El Greco from his native island of Crete to Venice, Rome, Madrid, and then Toledo, the ecclesiastical capital of Spain. The artist&#39;s unique ability to assimilate different artistic techniques and approaches to religion and philosophy enabled him to develop one of the most original styles of painting in the history of European art. Despite his highly successful career, El Greco was unappreciated for centuries after his death, and the book examines how his genius came to light again in the nineteenth century. For those looking for an excellent introduction to the life and work of this great artist, El Greco is a perfect choice.</p><p>This book is published to coincide with the El Greco exhibition at the National Gallery, London (February 11 to May 23, 2004).Xavier Bray is assistant curator of seventeenth- and eighteenth-century paintings at the National Gallery, London; Lois Oliver is assistant curator at the National Gallery, London.</p><h2>Athenaze: An Introduction to Ancient Greek Book 1 2e - UK Edition</h2><p>Combining the best features of traditional and modern methods, &#34;Athenaze&#34; provides a unique course of instruction that allows students to read connected Greek narrative from an early stage, and guides them to the point where they can read complete classical texts.

Others turn to Peter Rumancek, a Gypsy trailer-trash kid who has told impressionable high school classmates that he's a werewolf. Or perhaps it's Roman, the son of the late JR Godfrey, who rules the adolescent social scene with the casual arrogance of a cold-blooded aristocrat, his superior status unquestioned despite his decidedly freakish sister, Shelley, whose monstrous medical conditions belie a sweet intelligence, and his otherworldly control freak of a mother, Olivia. <br> At once a riveting mystery and a fascinating revelation of the grotesque and the darkness in us all, <i>Hemlock Grove</i> has the architecture and energy to become a classic in its own right&#x2015;and Brian McGreevy the talent and ambition to enthrall us for years to come.</p></p><p><p><b>Brian McGreevy</b> grew up near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and received his MFA from the Michener Center for Writers at the University of Texas.

But why does the pack howl when no wolf is lost?<br>Isn&#x2019;t it obvious?<br>Because there is no other way to say it.<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>The night after the Harvest Moon, the body was discovered. It was nearing October and the sun was still hot, but the leaves were falling now with intention and every night was colder. Peter was walking home from the bus stop when he saw the flashing light of a fire truck up at Kilderry Park. He wondered if there had been an accident. Peter, who was seventeen at the time of which I&#x2019;m writing, liked accidents: modern times were just so fucking structured. He saw in addition to the fire truck a few cop cars and an ambulance, but no signs of wreckage. He turned his head in passing, but there was nothing more to see beyond the norm. Two of the cops combing the area by the swings he knew; they&#x2019;d hassled him a couple of times in that kind of obligatory cop way that, in Peter&#x2019;s experience, every uniform was an SS uniform. Probably some junkie had OD&#x2019;d or something. There was that bum who hung out around here, an old black guy with yellow and black teeth and one dead eye that looked like a dirty marble who might not have been old, really. Peter had given him a light once, but no change. Better that paid for his own drugs. His interest flagged. Old black junkie kicks it it&#x2019;s no more news than chance of rain tomorrow. Then he heard it, one sentence. <i>No sign of a weapon, Sheriff.</i> Peter looked again but there was no more to see than a milling cluster of uniforms by the tree line and he put his hands in his pockets and went on.<br>He had a bad feeling.<br>Nicolae had always told him that he had been born with an unusually receptive Swadisthana chakra and that underneath the surfaces of things, the illusion of the illusion, there is a secret, sacred frequency of the universe and that the Swadisthana was the channel through which it would sing to you. And the Swadisthana being located of course just behind the balls, he should always always trust his balls. Peter did not know what it was, but something about the scene in Kilderry Park had his balls in a state of agitation.<br>When he got home he told his mother, &#x201c;Something happened.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Hmm?&#x201d; she said. She was smoking a joint and watching a quiz show. The trailer was warm and smelled sweet, pot and baked apple. &#x201c;Hummingbird!&#x201d; she yelled suddenly, in response to the question <i>What is the only bird that can fly backwards.</i><br>He told her what he saw. He told her he had a bad feeling.<br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, I just do,&#x201d; he said.<br>She was thoughtful. &#x201c;Well, there&#x2019;s cobbler,&#x201d; she said.<br>He went to the kitchen. She asked if he&#x2019;d been in town.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; he said.<br>She emptied his backpack of items so small and modest it could hardly be considered stealing while Peter scraped the tar of sugar at the edge of the cobbler and tried to shake this feeling. The feeling that whatever had happened in Kilderry Park was no good. And not in some greater existential sense but no good with his number on it. There was a coffee mug on the counter with the comic strip character Cathy on it and a small chip the shape of a shark&#x2019;s tooth that held loose change. He dipped his hand in the mug and went to the door and scattered a handful of coins on the stone path out front.<br>&#x201c;Why did you do that?&#x201d; said Lynda.<br>Peter shrugged. He had done it because he wanted to hear something dissonant and beautiful.<br>&#x201c;You are one strange customer, you know that?&#x201d; said Lynda.<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; said Peter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2012 by Brian McGreevy<br></p><h2>Macbeth: Library Edition</h2><p>The classic Shakespearean tale of power, deception, murder, and guilt is retold in simple-to-read prose for young readers and enhanced by bold and detailed illustrations.</p><p>Grade 2-7. Macbeth has strong appeal for young audiences and Coville's lucid retelling captures much of it. Aided by the short, intense, and uninterrupted story line of the play, the reteller deftly weaves many of the most familiar quotes with his own dramatic narrative. In a short preface that sketches a quick history of the play's popularity, Coville invokes cultural literacy as one of his missions. Despite this heavy burden, he carries off the telling with grace. Kelley's dark, evocative pastels reflect and intensify the ominous mood. Glowering hillsides, gloomy interiors, the handsome and doomed Macbeths, and truly ghastly witches create a mood worthy of the play. The only unfortunate image is the weak-chinned Macbeth reacting to Banquo's ghost with a look more comic than horrified. Darkness prevails until the final painting of light morning skies over the hills. Coville's muscular sentences, full of dramatic word choices, make this a good read-aloud choice. While not avoiding the horrors in the story, the reteller does not dwell on the goriest moments, letting the worst, such as the slaughtering of Macduff's children, happen offstage. The accurate depiction of the story will give older students or casual playgoers a good quick review. If it doesn't end up lost among the picture books, this retelling could have many uses.?Sally Margolis, formerly at Deerfield Public Library, IL<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Exploring Illustration (Design Concepts)</h2><p>Arguably the first standard textbook of its kind, Exploring Illustration presents a curriculum methodology to learning illustration.

They saw things no one had ever seen, and they experienced conditions no one was sure they could survive. This book tells the story of these brave and tenacious men as they labored on the cusp of a new age.<br>The author captures the drama of their spectacular achievements and those of many of the other space pioneers who made America's stratospheric balloon programs possible. Their now largely forgotten programs supplied many systems and processes adopted by NASA. Unfortunately, some of the valuable lessons they brought back from the edge of space were ignored - in at least one case, with disastrous consequences. Craig Ryan's argument is compelling for the inclusion of these men's achievements in the broad history of space exploration and astronautics. In their day, before Gagarin and Glenn and American flags on the Sea of Tranquillity, these pre-astronauts were the space program.</p><p>Craig Ryan is a pilot, balloonist, skydiver, and prize-winning writer who lives in Portland, Oregon. He is also the author of Beautiful New Mexico and Beautiful New York.Here is the Naval Institute Press at its best, offering a superb, thorough history of a subject most other publishers would ignore. Ryan's book is a complete accounting of the U.S. efforts at manned stratospheric ballooning between World War II and the first manned spaceflights of Project Mercury--missions that included not only scientific and would-be record-setting flights, but also high-altitude parachute jumps and airborne telescopic surveys. Ryan also provides capsule histories of modern manned ballooning and skydiving and vivid portraits of men and women who, on shoestring budgets, risked and sometimes lost their lives while gathering much of the research essential to eventually achieving manned spaceflight. In all, Ryan gives aviation and space buffs an absolute feast of information. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Harcourt Social Studies, Vol. 1: World History, Teacher&#39;s Edition</h2><p>Book by HARCOURT SCHOOL PUBLISHERS</p><p></p><h2>Calculus: A Complete Course, Seventh Edition (7th Edition)</h2><p><p>Proven in North America and abroad, this classic text has earned a reputation for excellent accuracy and mathematical rigour.

The Queen: Elizabeth II and the Monarchy. Golden Jubilee Edition. First edition. London, HarperCollins Publishers, 2001. 16 x 24cm. (20), 780 pages, with black and white plates. Original hardcover with dustjacket in protective Mylar. Excellent condition with only minor signs of shelf wear. A fully revised edition of Ben Pimlott&#39;s classic biography of Queen Elizabeth II of England. Ben Pimlott (described by Andrew Marr in the Independent as &#39;the best writer of political biography now writing&#39;) treats the Head of State - who has been uniquely placed at the centre of the national stage since childhood - to the rigorous and objective scrutiny he has applied to major political personalities, using a wide range of new sources, including interviews, diaries and letters, and papers in the Royal Archives. The Queen looks at the social, political and psychological aspects of his subject in detail, as well as at the changing role of Monarchy in the British Constitution.</p><p>Ben Pimlott is Professor of Politics and Contemporary History at Birkbeck College, London. He is the author of Labour and the Left in the 1930s (1977), Hugh Dalton (1985) which won the Whitbread Prize for Biography, Harold Wilson (1992) and Frustrate Their Knavish Tricks (1994). He has been a political columnist for The Times, New Statesman and Sunday Times. He also reviews regularly for the Independent on Sunday, Guardian and Observer.</p><h2>Water Light Time</h2><p>When David Doubilet was a child, he photographed swimmers in the waters off of New Jersey. Water Light Time is a collection of images that capture the underwater magnificence that seized the photographer&#39;s imagination in childhood and spurred a lifelong fascination. Underwater plant life floating like snakes, bright blue water filled with schools of silver fish, a diver immersed in a throng of bubbling yellow jellyfish, a close-up of pink and white sea anemones looking all the world like a floating bouquet of flowers--each image in this book is exquisitely photographed with preternaturally clear colors, full of detail and depth. Some images toy with perspective, creating surreal tableaux as a crustacean leg pokes out of the yellow-green water to appear almost as large as a nearby tree.With a career that started as a National Geographic photographer in 1972, Doubilet has a lifetime of experience from which to make such a marvelous meditation on this otherworld that is vaguely familiar to most readers only through pictures and visits to aquariums. Doubilet captures what must surely be his own awe at the uniqueness of being a human in this nonhuman environment, and the reader can marvel at both the lushness of life in the water and at the beauty of the photographs themselves, which dominate almost all of the book&#39;s 240 pages. --Jennifer Cohen</p><p>Beneath the world&#39;s waters lie landscapes, species, vegetations and populations as diverse as those on land, yet these kingdoms have been explored by few. This book looks at the work of David Doubilet, artist, diver, and underwater photographer. From the shores of the Galapogos to the Red sea, from the Pacific ocean to the fresh waters of North America, the book includes over 25 years of the photographer&#39;s work, and reveals the beauty of more than 30 bodies of water rich with life forms.Born in America in 1946, David Doubilet began snorkelling at the age of eight. By the age of 13, he was taking his first underwater photographs with a pre-war Leica in the green sea off the New Jersey coast. Having studied photography at Boston University, he published his first pictures in National Geographic in 1972 and has continued to do so regularly since then, reporting from oceans around the world. Doubilet has captured groundbreaking images of great white sharks, creatures of the undersea desert, flourescent corals and shipwrecks. Arguably the world&#39;s leading underwater photographer, Doubilet has received numerous awards including &#39;Pictures of the Year&#39; Competition repeatedly, as well as the prestigious Lennart Nilsson prize in 2001.</p><h2>Brokenness: How God Redeems Pain and Suffering</h2><p>In 1992, Pastor Lon Solomon&#39;s career was on a speedy ascent. He was the senior pastor at McLean Bible Church, an influential and rapidly growing church in the suburbs of the nation&#39;s capital. In his weekly sermons he was funny, engaging, and self-effacing. He was successful, comfortable, respected by his peers and reaching Washington&#39;s elite decision makers. His life could not have been better. That&#39;s precisely when his world began to crumble. He didn&#39;t see it at the time, but today Pastor Solomon knows that God was sending the blessing of brokenness to him. It came in the form of a beautiful daughter who for years would suffer through thousands of seizures and become severely impaired, physically and mentally. He and his family were thrust into days of emotional darkness. Pastor Solomon began to question his faith and feared he would fail his congregation. In this touching and important book, he tells how God shattered him for the sole purpose of helping him reach his full potential as a servant of Christ. Today, his church is having a major impact on Washington, D.C., with more than 10,000 worshipers attending services each weekend. Read this book and you&#39;ll never be the same.</p><p>Lon Solomon is the senior pastor at McLean Bible Church in the Virginia suburbs of Washignton, D.C. He was appointed by President George W. bush to serve as a member of the President&#39;s Committee on People with Intellectual Disabilities."This book will prove to be a valuable resource indeed, for anyone who has experienced pain and suffering." --Dr. Tim LaHaye, co-author Left Behind series, April 2005<br><br>"If you need encouragement and strength, Brokenness will help you through the difficult times from someone who has been there." --Dr. Jerry Falwell, Pastor Thomas Road Baptist Church, April 2005<br><br>"When Lon Solomon writes a book on Brokenness, I want to read it. He knows whereof he speaks." --David Brickner, Jews for Jesus, April 2005</p><h2>Thicker Than Water: Essays by Adult Siblings of People with Disabilities</h2><p>Bound by blood, but not always by love, a sibling can be your friend or rival, defender or detractor--sometimes simultaneously! But what's the impact on that bond when one sibling has a disability?<p> In this thought-provoking essay collection, thirty-nine adult siblings reflect on how their lives have been indelibly shaped by their relationship with a brother or sister with special needs. Edited by Don Meyer, creator of Sibshops and an expert on sibling issues, <b>Thicker Than Water</b> reveals both positive and negative aspects of growing up with someone who might have received the lion s share of his parents attention or who now requires extra support as an adult.</p><p> These compelling essays express a diverse range of sibling experiences and attitudes. Contributors range in age from 20 to 70 and have siblings whose disabilities include Down syndrome, autism, cerebral palsy, seizures, visual impairment, fragile-X syndrome, intellectual disability, or mental illness. Several essays demonstrate how experiences vary based on a writer s age and generation. Many older contributors grew up when disabilities were stigmatized; younger contributors can attest to changing attitudes and greater acceptance of people with differences. Some contributors have chosen to work in a disability field or service profession and credit their siblings for influencing their career choices; others have pursued dreams far removed from a disability field.</p><p> This absorbing collection offers other siblings the catharsis of discovery and shared experiences. <b>Thicker Than Water</b> provides fascinating reading for siblings, parents, caregivers, and anyone who shares a long-term relationship with a person with special needs or wonders what that experience may be like.</p><p> <i>A common element in all of the essays is honesty. A sibling writes...I did the usual things kids do while growing up--had friends--just never brought them home. Participated in Girl Scouts and cheerleading--just never had my family at events. Did Mom sense my embarrassment at having a brother with multiple disabilities--one who d whoop and strike the air with his fist at inappropriate times? (Is there an appropriate time? Football games?) Or was she ashamed of his behavior and I absorbed this shame? Because shame it was. I was ashamed of Jimmy. There. I wrote it. (Can t quite say it, though.) I was ashamed and now I m ashamed of my shame.</i> </p><p> <i>Also by Don Meyer</i>:<br> <b>Views from Our Shoes: Growing Up with a Brother or Sister with Special Needs</b><br> <b>The Sibling Slam Book: What It's Really Like to Have a Brother or Sister with Special Needs</b></p></p><p>Don Meyer is the director of the Sibling Support Project and creator of Sibshops, lively programs for brothers and sisters of kids with special needs.

Reprint.</p><p>The demon Lailoken, as old as time, is tricked by Fire-lords and trapped in a human body. He becomes Merlinus, a wandering wise man expert in magic, destined to work for good among humans, opposed by the Furor (Woden). An encounter with the unicorn--a spirit similarly earthbound--brings him to Ygrane, queen of the Celts, and she sets him a task to find her king, a man seen in vision and fated to be her love-match. Merlinus-Lailoken seeks and finds him: Theodosius, a stable worker. But Ygrane has commanded the demon-wizard to bring her a king, so Merlinus sets to work making one. <p> This is an entrancing fantasy, drawing on everything from Norse myths to feng shui to build a magical, liminal Arthurian Britain.</p>Old as the Big Bang, the <b>demon</b> Lailoken assumes human form in <b>Roman Britain </b>as Celts battle Saxons for mastery. The druid-queen he serves calls him Myrddin and sends him to find her true love--to fulfill an ancient prophecy at the frontier of life and death for her people. <br> &nbsp;<br> Led by a <b>unicorn</b> and hunted by a <b>dragon</b> vast as the planet, Myrddin becomes Merlinus on his quest for the queen's mate among her remorseless enemies, the Romans. And finally as <b>Merlin</b>, he matches wits with <b>gods and elves</b> to unite Celtic queen and Roman warlord and weave the <b>destiny</b> of the most famous king.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this first volume of Attanasio's <b>Arthurian saga</b>, all the core elements appear: chronicling Vortigern's defeat of the Saxons, the ascendancy of Theodosius Ambrosius (Uther Pendragon), <b>the birth of Arthur</b> and eventually Merlin's lodging <b>the sword in the stone.</b><br> &nbsp;<br> But in this vibrantly imagined world, the legends of northern Europe acquire their magical perspective from modern physics: <b>Yggdrasil the Storm Tree</b> fills the heavens as the magnetic field of the planet--the gods exist as electrostatic beings--and Merlin uses his humanity to disguise his true identity as a 'demon,' a hyperspatial mind created spontaneously out of chaos and known among thermodynamic theorists as a Boltzmann Brain. All of these marvels of science embedded in the twilight of Roman Britain, when the first Christian kingdoms of <b>Albion</b> fought for survival against ferocious pagan invaders.<br> &nbsp;<br> An encounter with a unicorn, an interplanetary being of light, brings Lailoken to <b>Ygrane</b>, queen of the Celts, and she sets him a task to find her king, a man seen in vision and fated for her true love.

Climate change is only the most visible of the modifications we&#39;ve made--up until this point, inadvertently--to the planet. And our current behavior threatens not only our own future but that of countless other creatures. By comparing Earth&#39;s story to those of other planets, astrobiologist David Grinspoon shows what a strange and novel development it is for a species to evolve to build machines, and ultimately, global societies with world-shaping influence. Without minimizing the challenges of the next century, Grinspoon suggests that our present moment is not only one of peril, but also great potential, especially when viewed from a 10,000-year perspective. Our species has surmounted the threat of extinction before, thanks to our innate ingenuity and ability to adapt, and there&#39;s every reason to believe we can do so again. Our challenge now is to awaken to our role as a force of planetary change, and to grow into this task. We must become graceful planetary engineers, conscious shapers of our environment and caretakers of Earth&#39;s biosphere. This is a perspective that begs us to ask not just what future do we want to avoid, but what do we seek to build? What kind of world do we want? Are humans the worst thing or the best thing to ever happen to our planet? Today we stand at a pivotal juncture, and the answer will depend on the choices we make.</p><p>David Grinspoon is an astrobiologist, award-winning science communicator, and prize-winning author. In 2013 he was appointed the inaugural Chair of Astrobiology at the Library of Congress. He is a frequent advisor to NASA on space exploration strategy, and is on the team for the Curiosity Mars Rover. Grinspoon's writing has appeared in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Slate</i>, <i>Scientific American</i>, <i>Seed</i>, <i>Boston Globe</i>, and the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>."In his wonderful writing style, Dr. Grinspoon spells it out: A single species is inducing more profound changes to our planet than any other organism in geologic history. It's us. If you have family and friends here on Earth, read this book. The Earth is in our hands."&#x2015;<b><i>Bill Nye "The Science Guy", <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of<i> Unstoppable: Harnessing Science to Change the World</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Earth in Human Hands</i> is a page-turning masterpiece of speculative nonfiction that will keep new and veteran science aficionados spellbound for hours at a time. It is quite simply the kind of book that can change a young reader's life, or inspire parents and teachers to do the same...Grinspoon ties together a dozen disparate themes pulled from a host of sub-fields seamlessly, making the book a delightful, flowing feast of science and commentary...Given Earth in the title, one might expect the book to revolve solely around our planet, the immediate concerns of humanity, or the growing anxiety voiced by environmentalists and a few scientists over our growing impact on this world. Grinspoon delivers all that with seeming ease. But he takes an epic, cosmic course to do so, one successfully charted by only a handful of visionaries before him. It's a journey that ranges from the planets Venus and Mars, where he deftly reviews the critical contributions NASA and other agencies have added to our understanding of our home by studying these alien worlds, to the farthest reaches of space and time revealed by modern astronomy....The only disappointment was when the last page was turned, and I found myself wishing there was more.If Carl Sagan were alive today, and had available to him all the science done since he left us, this is the book he would write....<i>Earth in Human Hands</i> is <i>Cosmos</i> for the 21st century, retooled for a new wave of readers, and hopped up on the best science modern research has to offer. ...Your copy of this masterpiece is destined to become a familiar friend, proudly dog-eared and creased with age, after being read and reread time after time, and year after year."&#x2015;<b><i>Daily Kos</i></b><br><br>"In flavorful prose, [Grinspoon] dives deep into the history of life on Earth (and beyond) and muses on ways that geoengineering, interplanetary colonization or contact with galactic civilizations could define this human-dominated epoch just as much as climate change, overpopulation and resource scarcity...What comes next? This hybrid of a meditative memoir, a scientific primer and a call to arms presents possible answers. "&#x2015;<b><i><i>Scientific American</i><br></i></b><br><br>"Grinspoon's writing is clear, informal and funny...like a pub conversation with a well-read, quick mind."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Nature</i></i></b><br><br>"<i>Earth in Human Hands</i> is a remarkable synthesis of natural history, planetary science, extinction histories, Earth's climate and the human effect on the world...If we do it right, the 21st century won't be the peak of human achievement, but rather our initial foray into a brilliant, uncertain but full-of-potential future."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Forbes</i></i></b><br><br>"Rarely is a science book profoundly informative, highly entertaining, and surprisingly filled with interesting tidbits as a memoir. Such is the case, however, from the new book <i>Earth in Human Hands</i>...This is a book that any thinking person will have been glad to read. One could hardly ask for more."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Astronomy Magazine</i></i></b><br><br>"With an erudite yet appealingly informal style that showcases his nimble mastery of this science, Grinspoon takes you on a deep-time tour...In our hyper-technical world, we need science communicators like Grinspoon (and Bill Nye and Neil deGrasse Tyson) who can translate their expertise into accessible explanations and interesting stories. All complex topics have interesting stories; it takes a particular talent to unlock them....This is one of the great strengths of "Earth in Human Hands": Grinspoon's ability to describe and explain momentous Earth and space events and discoveries, and then connect to their cultural and social influence; science as part of everyday life and our cultural history, not separate from it."&#x2015;<b><i>NPR Boston</i></b><br><br>"David Grinspoon has done it again: cracked open our universe with a scientific inquiry that is as inspiring and engaging as it is profound. Where others see inevitable catastrophe, Grinspoon sees historic opportunity. Grinspoon is a gifted storyteller and his narrative is the rare confluence of authoritative and thought-provoking science and rollicking fun. Earth in Human Hands is a must read for anyone interested in evolution, planetary science, the crisis of the environment, and human survival. Destined to be a classic."&#x2015;<b><i>Peter Heller, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Dog Stars</i> and <i>The Whale Warriors</i></i></b><br><br>"David Grinspoon's books are always high-spirited, insightful, elegantly-written, and full of fascinations, but EARTH IN HUMAN HANDS is especially so, because he focuses on our home planet and exciting/dangerous new age, criss-crossing the globe and traveling deep into the unknown reaches of space, where other lifeforms may be facing their own planetary challenges.

And this delectable cookbook from owner Fabrizia Lanza is the definitive source of authentic seasonal Sicilian foods. Co-authored with former <i>Gourmet</i> magazine editor Kate Winslow, it tells Fabrizia's story of coming home to the family estate, Regaleali, to assist her aging mother with the cooking school that she founded in 1989. Fabrizia writes eloquently and in detail about the seasonal harvests, the foods produced--cheeses, jams, olive oil, vin cotto, estratto, and more--and the loyal and talented staff who make it all possible. Along the way, she offers more than 100 family recipes that she shares with her students. Guy Ambrosino's stunning color photographs bring the beauty of Case Vecchie to life.</p><p>Fabrizia Lanza resides at Case Vecchie on her family's estate, Regaleali, in central Sicily.

The books he later wrote about this walk, <i>A Time of Gifts</i>, <i>Between the Woods and the Water</i>, and the posthumous <i>The Broken Road</i> are a half-remembered, half-reimagined journey through cultures now extinct, landscapes irrevocably altered by the traumas of the twentieth century. Aged eighteen, Nick Hunt read <i>A Time of Gifts</i> and dreamed of following in Fermor's footsteps.<br><br>In 2011 he began his own great trudge - on foot all the way to Istanbul. He walked across Europe through eight countries, following two major rivers and crossing three mountain ranges. Using Fermor's books as his only travel guide, he trekked some 2,500 miles through Holland, Germany, Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Turkey. His aim? To have an old-fashioned adventure. To slow down and linger in a world where we pass by so much, so fast. To discover for himself what remained of hospitality, kindness to strangers, freedom, wildness, adventure, the mysterious, the unknown, the deeper currents of myth and story that still flow beneath Europe's surface.</p><p>Nick Hunt has walked and written across much of Europe. His articles have appeared in the <em>Economist</em>, the <em>Guardian a</em>nd other publications, and he also works as a storyteller and co-editor for the Dark Mountain Project. His first book <em>Walking the Woods and the Water </em>(Nicholas Brealey, 2014) was a finalist for the Stanford Dolman Travel book of the Year. He currently lives in Bristol.With Walking the Woods and the Water, Mr. Hunt has created an illuminating addition to what the travel writer Robert Macfarlane calls 'the literature of the leg'. The shepherds and the fishermen are long gone, but Mr. Hunt controls his nostalgia and avoids mimicking Leigh Fermor's flamboyant style. Still, his inspiration rubs off, like the skin on Mr. Hunt's feet.&#x2015;<b>Wall Street Journal</b><br><br>A brave achievement.

Vive en Nueva York.</p>The signal event of this novel?the shooting of the protagonist's son?is announced early, and the rest of the book is imbued with a melancholy only occasionally illuminated by spiritual revelation or insight. Edward Ives is a foundling, adopted by a widowed print shop manager and raised uneventfully in an idyllic?though Depression-era?New York City of egg creams, stickball and melting-pot color. Ives's dark looks and his father's long history of working amiably with Cuban pressmen incline him toward a sympathy with Hispanics and their culture, which conveniently anchors Hijuelos in a world he knows well. As a child, Ives shows a penchant for drawing, and he meets his future wife, Annie MacGuire, in a class at the Art Students League. Their first child, Robert (or Roberto), born in 1950, is murdered at age 17 on the streets of New York by a Puerto Rican teenager. The case is celebrated?Robert had just decided to enter the priesthood and was killed for a measly $10; by his side was found a shopping bag full of record albums?Christmas presents carefully chosen for each member of his family. In his Pulitzer Prize-winning The Mambo Kings Play Songs of Love, Hijuelos showed he can sharply evoke a vibrant, multicultural New York, capturing its music, its menace and its smell. Here, however, every storefront is darkened by the grief of Edward Ives, and every note is tamped. It is as if the lovelorn Nestor of Mambo Kings has returned from the dead to play his sad arias in a world?and a book?absent his lively, spirited brother, Cesar. The author's attempts to render all this as a Dickensian tale of redemption through dignified suffering?Dickens is invoked more than a dozen times?are crude and work no wonders. Not even a long-foreshadowed and deferred meeting at the end of the book between Ives and his son's murderer helps: "Nothing monumental transpired. Niceties were exchanged." Same for the book.

"Fifty is a tough age," she writes. "Role models are scarce for women contemplating a second act." Scarce, that is, until she stumbled upon Fanny Trollope.</p><p>In 1827, Fanny, mother of Anthony, swapped England for Ohio with hopes of bolstering the family finances. There, failure and disappointment hounded the immigrant for three years before she returned home to write one of the most sensational travel accounts of the nineteenth century. <i>Domestic Manners</i> <i>of the Americans </i>made an instant splash on both sides of the Atlantic, where readers both relished and reviled Trollope's caustic take on the newly independent country. Her legacy became the stuff of legend: "Trollopize" emerged as a verb meaning "to abuse the American nation"; Mark Twain judged her the best foreign commentator on his country; the last king of France threw a ball in her honor. Fanny Trollope was forty-nine when she set out for America, and Wheeler, approaching fifty herself, was smitten. Fanny was living proof of life after fertility, and she led Wheeler to other trailblazers: the actress and abolitionist Fanny Kemble, the radical sociologist Harriet Martineau, the homesteader Rebecca Burlend, the traveler Isabella Bird, and the novelist Catherine Hubback&#x2015;women born within half a century of one another who all reinvented themselves in a transforming America, the land of new beginnings.</p><p>In <i>O My America!</i>, Wheeler tracks her subjects from the Mississippi to the cinder cones of the Mayacamas at the tail end of the Cascades, armed with two sets of maps for each adventure: one current and one the women before her would have used. Bright, spirited, and tremendous tantrum-throwers, these ladies proved to be the best travel companion Wheeler could have asked for. "I had more fun writing this book than all my previous books put together," she writes&#x2015;and it shows. Ambitious and full of life, <i>O My America! </i>is not only a great writer's reckoning with a young country, but also an exuberant tribute to fresh starts, second acts, and six unstoppable women.</p></p><p><p><b>Sara Wheeler</b> is the author of many books of biography and travel, including <i>Access</i> <i>All Areas: Selected Writings 1990&#x2013;2011 </i>(NPP, 2013) and <i>Travels in a Thin Country:</i> <i>A Journey Through Chile</i>. <i>Terra Incognita: Travels</i> <i>in Antarctica </i>was an international bestseller that <i>The New York Times </i>described as "gripping, emotional" and "compelling," and <i>The Magnetic North:</i> <i>Notes from the Arctic Circle </i>(FSG, 2011) was chosen as Book of the Year by Michael Palin and Will Self, among others. Wheeler lives in London.</p>1 <br>MERELY TELLING THE TRUTH <br> <i>Fanny Trollope Goes to Ohio</i> <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Fanny Trollope was broke when she turned fifty, and on intimate terms with pig manure. She had made the three-month trek to Cincinnati, she said, &#x201c;to hatch golden eggs for my son.&#x201d; The frontier might have glittered, but not all of it was gold&#x2014;Cincinnati turned out to be one big stinky pig factory (Easterners knew it as &#x201c;Porkopolis,&#x201d; if they knew it at all). After three years Fanny slunk home with a suitcase of smashed-up dreams and three children incubating tuberculosis. Then she wrote <i>Domestic Manners of the Americans</i>. The voice that sings from its pages speaks with the inflections of another age, but it is Fanny&#x2019;s voice: stylish and pithy, elegant, sardonic and witty. The author refused to acknowledge any taboo, complaining about the way American museum curators covered up the penes of the statues. There is something true at the heart of <i>Domestic Manners</i>. It is a story of disillusion, of seeking and not finding, of the gap between expectation and reality. <br>The book appeared on both sides of the Atlantic on March 19, 1832, when Fanny was fifty-three. A British subaltern in New York reported, &#x201c;The Tariff and Bank Bill were alike forgotten&nbsp;&#x2026; At every corner of the street, at the door of every petty retailer of information for the people, a large placard met the eye with, &#x2018;For sale here, with plates, <i>Domestic Manners of the Americans</i>, by Mrs. Trollope.&#x2019; At every table d&#x2019;h�te, on board of every steamboat, in every stagecoach, and in all societies, the first question was &#x2018;Have you read Mrs Trollope?&#x2019; The more it was abused the more rapidly did the printers issue new editions.&#x201d; In Britain the book whizzed through multiple reprints within weeks, and when Fanny&#x2019;s son Anthony produced his first novel, his roguish publisher placed adverts naming the author as <i>MRS</i>. Trollope. The family finances were at last secure, and Fanny&#x2019;s harrowing American experience brought her freedom in the long run. No wonder she laughed at the personal attacks pouring from the United States. A lithograph was published depicting a fat grotesque (her), a mysterious young artist friend with a brush in his mouth, and her husband in front of a stag&#x2019;s head sporting cuckold&#x2019;s horns. A waxwork in New York represented Fanny as a goblin, and a traveling menagerie in Maine advertised &#x201c;an exact likeness of the celebrated Mrs. Trollope&#x201d; in which she appeared puffing on a pipe. &#x201c;Trollopize&#x201d; became a verb that meant &#x201c;to abuse the American nation.&#x201d; &#x201c;No other author of the present day,&#x201d; wrote a critic, &#x201c;has been so much admired, and so much abused.&#x201d; On and on it went, for years. The author &#x201c;Nil Admirari&#x201d; published a verse epic called <i>The Trollopiad</i> about a band of pompous gentlemen travelers observing the United States. <br>Later, Fanny picked up one fan in America: Mark Twain. In his own maudlin middle years he took a library of European commentators on a nostalgic Mississippi voyage, and on the last page of his copy of <i>Domestic Manners</i> noted, in his sprawling hand, &#x201c;Of all these tourists, I like Dame Trollope best.&#x201d; She was, said the master stretcher-teller, &#x201c;merely telling the truth.&#x201d; He recognized in her his own unquenchable gusto for life. Meanwhile, in Britain, invitations tumbled through the letterbox. Fanny rented a flat in a top London square and hurried between parties. &#x201c;Lady Louisa Stewart,&#x201d; she gushed to her son Tom, &#x201c;told me that I had quite put English out of fashion, and that every one was talking Yankee talk.&#x201d; The young Dickens praised her. &#x201c;I am convinced,&#x201d; he wrote, &#x201c;that there is no writer who has so well and so accurately (I need not add entertainingly) described America.&#x201d; Tory papers loved <i>Domestic Manners</i> while Whigs and Radicals noted that the author&#x2019;s background was not quite up to scratch. Britons can never escape their origins. In Anthony Trollope&#x2019;s novel <i>Is He Popenjoy?</i>, the Dean of Brotherton&#x2019;s father is a former groom. &#x201c;The man looked like a gentleman,&#x201d; the author says of the Dean, &#x201c;but still there was the smell of the stable.&#x201d; In <i>Domestic Manners</i>, Fanny insists that there <i>should</i> be a stable smell, so that one knew where one was&#x2014;the alternative was a social free-for-all of the American kind. She needn&#x2019;t have worried. When the book came out, the cultural elite showed that hierarchies were alive and well in Britain. They resented the author of <i>Domestic Manners</i> for entering their territory. The poet Robert Browning announced that Fanny was vulgar and pushy. <br>Over the next few years, following the appearance of <i>Domestic Manners</i>, Fanny nursed her tubercular offspring with one hand and dashed out novels with the other, &#x201c;So that,&#x201d; as Anthony put it, &#x201c;there might be a decent roof for the children to die under.&#x201d; When there was nobody left alive to nurse, Fanny swanned round the great capitals: Prince Metternich escorted her into dinner and the last king of France held a ball in her honor. It was one of the most dramatic reinventions of all time. She loved life, and never gave up on it. &#x201c;Of all the people I have known,&#x201d; Anthony wrote, &#x201c;my mother was the most joyous, or at any rate, the most capable of joy.&#x201d; <br>She was born Frances Milton in Bristol halfway through the long reign of George III, the Hanoverian known as The King Who Lost America. Like me, she was descended from generations of hardy West Country stock. Her father was a parson and her grandfather a distiller, and she grew up on a street that runs between Clifton Hill and York Place, close to the Hot Wells spa where the slavers&#x2019; wives took the waters. As a young woman Fanny moved to London to keep house for her brother in a dirty red-brick terrace sheathed in fog, and when she was thirty she married Thomas Trollope, a tow-headed barrister with a penchant for reckless schemes. Choleric (according to a colleague he was &#x201c;industrious and disputatious in equal measure&#x201d;) and an original Casaubon, Thomas was compiling an ecclesiastical dictionary and practicing law in what Anthony described as &#x201c;dingy, almost suicidal chambers at No. 23 Old Square, Lincoln&#x2019;s Inn.&#x201d; At home at 16 Keppel Street the couple shared a ruinous sense of entitlement that led to the purchase of French marquetry desks, grand pianos and glazed wallpaper, and they maintained a minimum staff of half a dozen. During the first decade of their marriage they produced seven children and regularly leaped over the back wall to escape a creditor. &#x201c;My father,&#x201d; wrote Tom, their eldest, &#x201c;was a poor man, and his establishment [the chambers] altogether on a modest footing. But it never would have occurred to him or to my mother that they could get on without a manservant in livery.&#x201d; When Thomas senior&#x2019;s law practice finally petered out, the family abandoned London for Harrow on the Hill, five miles outside the city, first renting a farmhouse, then leasing land to build a larger home with French windows, a lawn and a commodious parlour. Thomas was determined to set up as a gentleman farmer. The project, Anthony said, was to be the grave of all his father&#x2019;s hopes, ambitions and prosperity. Calomel prescribed for sick headaches raised Thomas&#x2019; cantankerous outbursts to new heights (no wonder&#x2014;it is mercurous chloride). &#x201c;He is a good, honourable man,&#x201d; Fanny confided to a friend, &#x201c;but his temper is dreadful&#x2014;every year increases his irritability&#x2014;and also its lamentable effects upon the children.&#x201d; Two of the seven children died: one a baby, the other, the beloved Arthur, at the age of twelve. Fanny, undiminished, held the family together. Thomas was, according to Tom, &#x201c;a highly respected but not a popular or well-beloved man. Worst of all, alas! he was not popular in his own house&nbsp;&#x2026; My mother&#x2019;s disposition, on the other hand, was of the most genial, cheerful, happy, <i>enjou�</i> nature imaginable. All our happiest hours were spent with her; and to any one of us t�te-�-t�te with her was preferable to any other disposal of a holiday hour.&#x201d; He said she &#x201c;carried sunshine.&#x201d; Fanny marched her brood through London&#x2019;s smoking gaslights and yellow fogs to watch <i>Hamlet</i> or <i>Doctor Faustus</i>, and once queued for four hours to see Mrs. Siddons play Lady Macbeth. She enjoyed dancing, hiking and throwing parties, and above all was a passionate reader: unfinished books lay about the house like partly eaten sandwiches. Fanny considered herself a progressive radical, and knew many of the freethinkers floating round the capital in the 1820s. The Harrow farmhouse became a refuge for liberals seeking a temporary berth. <br>When the red-haired writer and social reformer Fanny Wright appeared dressed in Grecian robes, she dazzled Fanny, and introduced her to the idea of America. Tall and lithe with milky skin and a substantial inheritance, the Scots-born Wright had visited the States twice and was passionate about that country&#x2019;s potential as a utopian democracy free from the conservative conventions of the Old World. She was close to the septuagenarian General Lafayette, the aristocrat who had served in the American War of Independence. (Washington said Lafayette was the only Frenchman he liked.) Wright had even accompanied the old soldier to America on his triumphal return tour in 1824; some said she had joined him in his bed. She stayed in America for two years, visiting Economy, a commune near Pittsburgh, and the Wabash River bottomland in Indiana where the Welsh industrialist Robert Owen had founded New Harmony, a communitarian experiment in which money was banned. Socialism, rationalism, women&#x2019;s rights, free love&#x2014;Wright was for it all. Convinced that she could prove the equality of the races, she had bought 200 acres on Tennessee&#x2019;s Wolf River to establish a cooperative community where black and white would live in peace and harmony. When she met Fanny Trollope in Harrow, she had left her sister Camilla in charge at her commune, which she called Nashoba (Chickasaw for wolf), and had returned to Europe to recruit candidates willing to join her in the Tennessee co-op. Fanny was like a ripe plum, just right for picking. Thomas had just moved the family into a semi-derelict outbuilding and installed tenants in the main farmhouse. The accommodation, Anthony remembered, &#x201c;always seemed to be in danger of falling into the neighbouring horse pond. As it crept downwards from house to stables, from stables to barns, from barns to cowsheds, and from cowsheds to dung heap, one could hardly tell where one began and the other ended.&#x201d; No wonder Fanny became obsessed with Wright. She confided to a friend, &#x201c;Fanny Wright is at once all that woman should be&nbsp;&#x2026; I feel greatly inclined to say where her country is, there shall be my country. The more I see of her, the more I feel convinced that <i>all</i> her notions are right.&#x201d; Tennessee was Fanny&#x2019;s last best hope. <br>People did not expect menopausal women to reinvent themselves. &#x201c;I can scarcely believe,&#x201d; one acquaintance wrote to another, &#x201c;that Mrs. T is actually on her way, and Trollope in his old age alone in London.&#x201d; &#x201c;Will wonders never cease?&#x201d; wrote another. It was indeed a wonder, and I admired it. I didn&#x2019;t know what home meant until I had children, and I can barely imagine the courage required to uproot as Fanny did. When I became a mother, I worried that I would never be truly free to take off again. I know it&#x2019;s heretical to say it. At the time it felt heretical to feel it. I was forty-one when I had my second son, and I asked myself if, once he and his brother were gone, it would be too late. <br>As for Fanny&#x2019;s children: twelve-year-old Anthony and seventeen-year-old Tom, boarders at Hampshire&#x2019;s Winchester College, were to stay in England. Fanny took the other three with her&#x2014;the feckless sixteen-year-old Henry, who was to teach Latin, fencing and dancing at Nashoba; Cecilia, who was eleven; and Emily, nine. Two servants agreed to take a chance with the party, and so did Auguste-Jean-Jacques Hervieu, a thirty-five-year-old French artist with a heroic moustache and republican views unappreciated by the authorities of his homeland. Hervieu was in search of a family: his father, a colonel in Napoleon&#x2019;s army, had perished on the outskirts of Moscow. The Trollopes had unofficially adopted him, installing him as drawing master at the farmhouse, and as an artist they held him in high regard. Hervieu was, Fanny said, &#x201c;among the many young Frenchmen who have been exiled for wishing for more freedom than the Bourbon fools and knaves allowed&nbsp;&#x2026; if I have any knowledge of what is meant by the phrase, a man of genius, I conceive it to belong to him.&#x201d; <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The sailing ship <i>Edward</i> reached the mouth of the Mississippi in December 1827. &#x201c;The first indication of our approach to land,&#x201d; Fanny wrote, &#x201c;was the appearance of this mighty river pouring forth its muddy mass of waters.&#x201d; Flights of pelicans thrilled her, and so did alligators, which she called crocodiles. Trunks of mighty trees uprooted by a hurricane span in the current &#x201c;like the fragment of a world in ruins.&#x201d; Bristolians are accustomed to narrow, placid rivers like the Avon, which subsides to a trickle twice a day, and Fanny&#x2019;s description of the Mississippi as it decants into the Gulf of Mexico displays a touch of the Gothic. &#x201c;Only one object rears itself above the eddying waters,&#x201d; she wrote. &#x201c;The mast of a vessel long since wrecked in attempting to cross the [sand] bar, a dismal witness of the destruction that has been, and a boding prophet of that which is to come.&#x201d; Above all she was amazed at the flatness of the shores and the ferocity of the river, &#x201c;looking so mighty, and so unsubdued all the time, that I could not help fancying she would some day take the matter into her own hands again, and if so, farewell to New Orleans.&#x201d; <br>The party found lodgings on Canal Street early in the evening, as the nabobs were talking on their second-floor verandas. Below, crowds drifted towards the Vieux Carr� and its Franco-Spanish houses of yellow adobe or stuccoed brick, the hinges on the gates a yard long, and on past the white walls of the St. Charles Hotel, where planters danced in the Salle de Cond�. New Orleans was the fifth-largest city in the nation and the unofficial capital of the South. West African freemen, Europeans and Creoles traded with Atakapa hunters bringing alligators they had speared through the eye, and with shaggy French-speaking Acadians who rode into town to barter sugar for tin pots. Twenty-four years after the Louisiana Purchase&#x2014;the biggest land sale in history, and one that doubled the size of the U.S.&#x2014;the city had already established its place in American geomythology: sexy, hot and slightly dangerous. When Fanny arrived the sugar elite had just appeared from the plantations for a three-month spree. Shopkeepers beckoned chatelaines who craved everything French, from yards of Parisian lace to cases of Sauternes, and the city imported so much Limoges china that an entrepreneurial Limousin had shipped in a team of potters and set up production near a clay pit. But the people of New Orleans didn&#x2019;t want that. The dinner service had to be made in France. (The thing was to go full circle. When I was living in Paris in the 1970s, older people still said, &#x201c; <i>Mais c&#x2019;est l&#x2019;Am�rique!</i>&#x201d; to describe something luxuriously desirable.) Fanny liked it all, but when she entered a milliner&#x2019;s shop, another customer introduced her to the milliner&#x2014;a shopgirl&#x2014;and the two enjoyed an &#x201c;intellectual&#x201d; conversation. It was &#x201c;the first symptom of American equality that I perceived,&#x201d; Fanny wrote. The incident was to reverberate throughout her American sojourn. In New Orleans she kept an open mind, noting the division between &#x201c;two distinct sets of people&#x201d;: the white Creole, and the mixed-race Quadroon. The latter she admired. ...</p><h2>Resonate with Stillness: Daily Contemplations</h2><p>The teachings of Swami Muktananda and Gurumayi Chidvilasananda are dated and arranged into 12 themes of spiritual life to be used for daily meditiation.<br></p><p><b>Swami Muktananda</b> introduced the Siddha Yoga path all over the world, creating what he called a "meditation revolution."

But the Puritans and the shining city on the hill give us just one way to understand the United States. Rather than recite American history from a Christian vantage point, Peter Manseau proves that what really happened is worth a close, fresh look. <br><br>Thomas Jefferson himself collected books on all religions and required that the brand new Library of Congress take his books, since Americans needed to consider the "twenty gods or no god" he famously noted were revered by his neighbors. Looking at the Americans who believed in these gods, Manseau fills in America's story of itself, from the persecuted "witches" at Salem and who they really were, to the persecuted Buddhists in WWII California, from spirituality and cults in the '60s to the recent presidential election where both candidates were for the first time non-traditional Christians.<br><br><i>One Nation, Under Gods </i>shows how much more there is to the history we tell ourselves, right back to the country's earliest days<i>. </i>Dazzling in its scope and sweep, it is an American history unlike any you've read.</p><p>Peter Manseau holds a doctorate in religion from Georgetown University and currently serves as the first-ever Curator of American Religious History at the Smithsonian. He is the author of <i>Rag and Bone</i>, <i>Songs for the Butcher's Daughter</i>, and <i>Vows</i>. He lives in Annapolis, Maryland.<strong>Praise for ONE NATION, UNDER GODS</strong><br><br>"Subversive and much-needed...[a] tour de force. A thorough reimagining of our nation's religions.... Engagingly written, with a historian's eye for detail and a novelist's sense of character and timing, this history from another perspective reexamines familiar tales and introduces fascinating counternarratives."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Publishers Weekly </i>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"The United States is arguably the most religiously diverse nation in the world. Peter Manseau shows how this has always been the case. <i>One Nation, Under Gods</i> is a refreshing, compelling, and surprising reexamination of our nation's history that puts lie to the oft-quoted idea that America was founded as 'a Christian nation.'"<strong></strong>&#x2015;<b><i>Reza Aslan, author of <i>No god but God</i> and <i>Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth</i></i></b><br><br>"Accessible and insightful prose... A richer, more complex, and compelling viewpoint that is reminiscent of Howard Zinn's <i>People's History of the United States</i>... This significant and timely work is important for those who wish to understand the complete and diverse landscape of religious history in America--but even more valuable for those who don't."&#x2015;<b><i>Erin Entrada Kelly, <i>Library Journal </i>(starred review)</i></b><br><br>"What the author endeavors to do here--and does so with deep-running stories told with verve and dash--is to square that narrative with a religious syncretism that provides a more colorful, distinct, eccentric, not to mention truthful, historical record.... An eye-opener. After reading Manseau, readers will see the influences he writes about not only dot, but shape, the landscape."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Kirkus</i></i></b><br><br>"With a novelist's verve and a historian's precision, Manseau deftly guides us through a cacophonous religious landscape, studded with encounters so unexpected and bizarre that they could be the stuff of speculative fiction.... Manseau's book likewise represents a remarkable gathering of American spiritual voices. Much more than a simple catalogue of diversity, <i>One Nation, Under Gods</i> is a stunning history of religious cross-pollination."&#x2015;<b><i>Tanya Erzen, <i>Bookforum</i><i></i></i></b><br><br>"With tales of secret faiths, false tolerance and quiet yet formidable dissent, each chapter is a window onto lives that were lived on the margin of Christian narratives. And along with a few intriguing statistics, like the fact that 20 percent of Africans in the early colonies were Muslim, and that most of the colonists didn't bother to go to church, they shine a light on history's finer strands.... [A] lively, refreshing account."&#x2015;<b><i>Damaris Colhoun, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></i></b><br><br>"Manseau artfully packs each profile with context, adding the occasional soup�on of drama to assure maximal, enthralling readability."&#x2015;<b><i><i>Booklist</i></i></b><br><br>"Here at last is the rest of the American story, in one great kaleidoscope of a book. Peter Manseau has revealed the many too often obscured by 'one nation.' The truth is so much more vast and strange and funny and fascinating than that, and Manseau, a brilliant writer of great wit, curiosity, and learning, is the perfect guide."&#x2015;<b><i>Jeff Sharlet, author of <i>The Family</i></i></b><br><br>"Truth telling and riveting storytelling don't always go hand in hand, but they do in this necessary history of America's stunningly diverse religious heritage."&#x2015;<b><i>Cathleen Medwick, <i>MORE Magazine</i></i></b><br><br>"An unusual work of history... A series of isolated snapshots, each chapter telling the story of a person considered a heretic, blasphemer, atheist or heathen, who nevertheless helped in some way to shape the course of American history."&#x2015;<b><i>Laura Miller, <i>Salon</i></i></b></p><h2>Escape, Evasion and Revenge</h2><p>Peter Stevens was a German-Jewish refugee who escaped Nazi persecution as a teenager in 1933. He joined the RAF in 1939 and after eighteen months of pilot training he started flying bombing missions against his own country. He completed twenty-two missions before being shot down and taken prisoner by the Nazis in September 1941. To escape became his raison d'�tre and his great advantage was that he was in his native country. He was recaptured after each of his several escapes, but the Nazis never realized his true identity. He took part in the logistics and planning of several major breakouts, including The Great Escape, but was never successful in getting back to England. After liberation, when the true nature of his exploits came to light, he was awarded the Military Cross. He then served as a British spy at the beginning of the Cold War before emigrating to Canada to resume a normal life.<br><br>This is the story of a heavily conflicted young man, alone in a world that is in the midst of destruction. He is afforded an opportunity to help his persecuted people to obtain a small measure of revenge. It is at once a sad yet uplifting tale of thankless and unheralded heroism.</p><p></p><h2>The Forgetting Room</h2><p>An illustrated novel chronicles a discontented man&#39;s search for the meaning of the inheritance left to him by his grandfather, an artist</p><p>... to my grandson, Armon Hurt, I leave my house in Ronda, Spain and the uncertainty of its contents.

She lives in Clear Lake, IowaGarlock's ( Homeplace ) trite, cliche-ridden tale is set in the years before and after World War I. When 15-year-old Letty Pringle becomes pregnant, her father, a hypocritical evangelical minister, beats her and orders her to "take your hot little twat and leave my house." Her lover,stet comma Mike Dolan, has left home to find work so that he can marry Letty, not knowing she is pregnant. Mike returns to hear that Letty is dead--her father having publicly announced her demise--and enlists to fight in the warp. 58 . In fact, Letty has taken refuge on her grandparents' Nebraska farm, convinced that Mike has abandoned her.

However, Letty's wise, old Grandpa Jacob, along with her and Mike's son, Patrick,stet commas and Helen, a child fostered out to Letty's care, give the determined lover a place in their hearts.

This time Spenser and his buddy Hawk are helping a couple of troubled friends (i.e., they're working without a fee). The first case involves the denial of tenure for Professor Robinson Nevins. While tenure meetings are always closed-door affairs, Nevins assumes that the recent suicide of graduate student Prentice Lamont (who some claim was having an affair with Nevins) ruined his chances for a coveted permanent position. Spenser and Hawk cut a brawl-strewn path through the members of the tenure committee on their way to the surprising truth of the Nevins case. The other investigation pits Spenser against the unknown stalker of K.C. Roth. Spenser's girlfriend, Susan, has known K.C. for a while, and while the PI finds Ms. Roth a bit melodramatic, he's always eager to help a damsel in distress. The only problem is that after he's apparently resolved the case, K.C. begins a little stalking of her own--of Spenser. <p> The book is driven by the controversies surrounding political correctness that Parker always loves to confront, and it's fun to watch Spenser struggle (a little) to resist K.C.'s advances. It's also a (slightly disturbed) pleasure to see Spenser and Hawk address some academic hypocrisy with their own special brand of reasoning. Not a mystery for the cozy-loving palette, <i>Hush Money</i>'s literate, tough-guy dialogue shows why Parker is the rightful heir to the throne of Chandler. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>Robert B.

In her spare time, MacLeod wrote short stories, and in 1964 she published her first novel, a children&#x2019;s book called <i>Mystery of the White Knight. </i><br> &nbsp;In <i>Rest You Merry</i> (1978), MacLeod introduced Professor Peter Shandy, a horticulturist and amateur sleuth whose adventures she would chronicle for two decades. <i>The Family Vault </i>(1979) marked the first appearance of her other best-known characters: the husband and wife sleuthing team Sarah Kelling and Max Bittersohn, whom she followed until her last novel, <i>The Balloon Man</i>, in 1998.YA Young adult readers with a lively sense of humor and an appreciation for the fine old family names such as Fortitude Lumpkin will find the latest Peter Shandy mystery to their liking. Balaclava Agriculture College has two problems: the unfortunate discovery of three victims of very foul play and (more importantly) a lawsuit by the greedy heirs of college founder Balaclava Buggins to reclaim part of the college, namely Oozak's Pond. With his usual aplomb and the help of the college community and various bizarre local folk, Professor Shandy solves both problems to the vast enjoyment of readers.

Someone was following her. She had read about stalkers, but they belonged in a different, faraway world. She had no idea who it could be, who would want to harm her. She was trying desperately hard not to panic, but lately her sleep had been filled with nightmares, and she had awakened each morning with a feeling of impending doom. Thus begins Sidney Sheldon s chilling novel, Tell Me Your Dreams. Three beautiful young women are suspected of committing a series of brutal murders. The police make an arrest that leads to one of the most bizarre murder trials of the century. Based on actual events, Sheldon s novel races from London to Rome to Quebec City to San Francisco, with a climax that will leave the reader stunned.</p><p>William Dalrymple is the author of five acclaimed works of history and travel, including <i>City of Djinns</i>, which won the Sunday Times Young Writer of the Year Award and the Thomas Cook Travel Book Award; the best-selling <i>From the Holy Mountain; </i>and <i>White Mughals, </i>which won Britain&#x2019;s most prestigious history prize, the Wolfson<i>.</i> He divides his time between New Delhi and London, and is a contributor to <i>The New York Review of Books, The New Yorker</i> and <i>The Guardian</i>.<b>Chapter One: A Chessboard King </b><br><br>The marriage procession of Prince Jawan Bakht left the Lahore Gate of the Red Fort at 2 a.m. on the hot summer night of 2 April 1852. <br><br>With a salute from the cannon stationed on the ramparts, and an arc of fireworks and rockets fired aloft from the illuminated turrets of the Fort, the two gates opposite the great thoroughfare of Chandni Chowk swung open. <br><br>The first to emerge were the <i>chobdars</i>, or mace bearers. The people of Delhi have never much liked being restrained by barriers and were in the habit of breaking through the bamboo railings hung with lamps that illuminated the processional route. It was the job of the <i>chobdars</i> to clear a way through the excitable crowd, before the imperial elephants&#x2014;always a little unpredictable in the presence of fireworks&#x2014;appeared lumbering through the gates. <br><br>Two ministers of state on horseback began the procession proper. Shell ornaments were plaited into the horses&#x2019; manes, and bells strung around their necks and fetlocks, and as they rode out, the ministers were attended by servants with <i>punkahs</i> (fans). Then came a troop of Mughal infantry, with polished black shields and curved swords, long lances and fluttering pennons of green and gold. <br><br>The first six of the imperial elephants followed, caparisoned with gold and saffron headcloths embroidered with the Emperor&#x2019;s coat of arms. From the howdahs, officials held aloft the dynastic insignia that had been used by the Mughals since their arrival in India more than three centuries earlier: from one, the face of a rayed sun; from another, two golden fish suspended at each end of a golden bow; from the third, the head of a lion-like beast; from the fourth, a golden Hand of Fatima; from the fifth, a horse&#x2019;s head; and from the last, a <i>chatri</i>, or imperial umbrella. All were made of gold and were raised on gilt staffs from which trailed silken streamers. <br><br>There then emerged in turn a party of red-tunicked Palace servants carrying covered trays of food and gifts for the bride&#x2019;s family; a squadron of camels, with drums beating and guns firing in the air; a small regiment of British sepoys led by Captain Douglas, Commandant of the Palace Guards, all in tight-fitting busbees and blue-and-saffron uniforms, and escorting two light cannon; a troop of Skinner&#x2019;s Horse in their yellow tunics and scarlet sashes, topped by armoured breastplates and medieval-looking helmets; a group of bullock-drawn wagons on which sat several bands of Mughal kettle drummers,&nbsp;<i>shanai</i> players, trumpeters and cymbal clashers; and a European brougham carriage, painted kingfisher blue, containing a party of senior princes, their gilt brocade flashing in the light of the exploding fireworks. <br><br>After each group came parties of torchbearers, holding their flames aloft, interspersed with men holding candles in glass bell jars. There were also gangs of water carriers emptying their skins onto the road&nbsp; in an attempt to settle the billowing summer dust kicked up by the procession. <br><br>After the brougham there came a second, smaller group of younger princes, this time riding on horseback; and among them, in the very centre, rode the groom. Mirza Jawan Bakht was only eleven years old, a young bridegroom even in a society that tended to marry its offspring early in adolesence. Immediately behind the Prince swayed the elephant on which rode the Emperor himself, sitting in his golden howdah and decked out, despite the sweltering night heat, in his state robes and jewels, and attended by his personal bearer holding a peacock fan. The rest of the court followed behind on foot, a great snaking queue stretching back through Chatta Chowk, the Fort bazaar, to the Naqqar Khana Darwaza, or the Gate of the Drum House, in the very centre of the Fort.<br><br>Not long before this, the Emperor and Jawan Bakht had both sat for the Austrian artist August Schoefft. The portrait of Zafar depicts a dignified, reserved and rather beautiful old man with a fine aquiline nose and a carefully trimmed beard. Despite his height and surprisingly broad and muscular build, there is a profound gentleness and sensitivity in his large brown watery eyes with their unusually long lashes. As a teenage prince, Zafar had always appeared in his portraits as a slightly awkward and uncertain figure, plump, visibly ill at ease and thinly bearded. But as youth gave way to middle age he had grown into his looks, and in old age&#x2014;unusually&#x2014;looked finer than ever. Now in his mid-seventies, his cheeks were sallow, his nose more pronounced and his bearing more regal. Yet as the elderly monarch kneels, wearily fingering his beads, there remains in the expression of his dark eyes something unmistakably melancholic; in the set of his full lips there is still that air of sad, patient resignation visible in the earlier pictures. Schoefft shows Zafar a little swamped under the brocade cloth of gold which adorns him, somewhat weighed down by the huge blood-coloured rubies and the strings of vast pearls, each the size of a partridge egg, which seem to hang so heavily around his neck. It is a portrait of a man imprisoned by the trappings of his office. <br><br>By contrast, the young Jawan Bakht, the Emperor&#x2019;s favourite son, seems to relish all the pearls and gems, the jewelled daggers and inlaid swords with which he is bedecked with a lavishness almost equal to that of his father. His expression is different too: knowingly handsome, and oddly cocky and confident for a boy of eleven. He is as strikingly sure of himself as his father appears wearily uncertain.<br><br>One person missing from both the portraits and the wedding procession was the woman who had done more than anything else to bring the marriage about. For months, Zafar&#x2019;s favourite wife, Zinat Mahal, had been preparing for this day. In Mughal tradition, women did not accompany the <i>barat</i> taking the groom to his marriage&#x2014;not even mothers and queens; but every detail of the procession had been planned by her. For Mirza Jawan Bakht was Zinat Mahal&#x2019;s only son, and her one ambition, to which she held consistently throughout her life, was to see Jawan Bakht, Zafar&#x2019;s fifteenth son, placed on the throne at the death of his father. <br><br>The exceptionally lavish wedding she had planned was intended by her to raise the profile of the Prince, and also to consolidate her own place in the dynasty: Jawan Bakht&#x2019;s bride, the Nawab Shah Zamani Begum, who was probably no more than ten years old at the time of the wedding, was Zinat&#x2019;s niece, and her father, Walidad Khan of Malagarh, an important ally of the Queen. While so young a couple would not be expected to consummate their marriage for a year or two, or even to live together, political considerations meant that the marriage should go ahead immediately, without having to wait for the couple to reach puberty. <br><br>As conceived by Zinat, the wedding of Mirza Jawan Bakht was of a scale unparalleled in Delhi in living memory, eclipsing the weddings of all Jawan Bakht&#x2019;s elder brothers. Sixty years later, the young courtier Zahir Dehlavi, whose job it was to oversee the care of the <i>Mahi</i> <i>Maraatib</i>, or Fish Standard, still remembered the aroma of the trays of food from the royal kitchens that had been sent out to every Palace official, and the spectacular entertainments that preceded the main celebration: &#x201c;Such beauty and magnificence had never been seen before,&#x201d; he wrote many years later, in exile in Hyderabad. &#x201c;At least not in my lifetime. It was a celebration I shall never forget.&#x201d;<br><br>The festivities had begun three days before the marriage with a procession from the house of Walidad Khan to the Palace, bearing the principal wedding gifts, followed by fireworks: &#x201c;a brilliant train of elephants, camels, horses and conveyances of every denomination,&#x201d; according to the <i>Delhi Gazette</i>. This led on to the ceremony of the <i>mehndi</i>, when the hands of the couple and their guests, including all the women of the Palace, were decorated with henna; the celebrations would continue for a further seven days beyond the night of the wedding ceremony. <br><br>On the evening of the great procession, at the beginning of the night vigil known as the <i>ratjaga</i>, Zafar had bestowed on Jawan Bakht a wedding veil made of strings of pearls known as a <i>sehra</i>, and simultaneous parties of escalating grandeur had been arranged for the different ranks of the Palace, each with their own musicians and troupes of dancing girls. Selected townspeople were in one courtyard, Palace children and students in another, senior officials in a third, and the princes in a fourth.<br><br>Since Zafar&#x2019;s financial resources rarely matched his spending, let alone that of his wife, much of the initial work for the wedding had involved arranging loans from Delhi moneylenders, who knew from experience what the chances were of seeing their cash again. Since December, the British Resident&#x2019;s diary of court proceedings had been full of Zinat&#x2019;s attempts to procure the large amounts needed, something she achieved in the end with the aid of the notoriously ruthless Chief Eunuch of the Palace, Mahbub Ali Khan. The Palace was repaired, spring-cleaned and superbly decorated with lamps and chandeliers. Getting sufficiently magnificent fireworks was another major concern, with pyrotechnicians from across Hindustan summoned to the Palace throughout January and February to demonstrate their skills.<br><br>The rockets, squibs and Roman candles were still exploding around the great red sandstone curtain walls of the Fort as the wedding procession slowly proceeded westwards down the top of Chandni Chowk, with its trees and central canal glittering in the light of the torches. It snaked onwards, past the gardens of Begum Sumru&#x2019;s haveli, recently taken over by the new Delhi Bank, and through the Dariba&#x2014;now in the light of ten thousand candles and lanterns haloed in dust&#x2014;before veering left and head...</p><h2>Intervention (Intervention Series, Book 1)</h2><p><p>Barbara Covington has one more chance to save her daughter from a devastating addiction, by staging an intervention. But when eighteen-year-old Emily disappears on the way to drug treatment&#x2014;and her interventionist is found dead at the airport&#x2014;Barbara enters her darkest nightmare of all. Barbara and her son set out to find Emily before Detective Kent Harlan arrests her for a crime he is sure she committed. Fearing for Emily&#x2019;s life, Barbara maintains her daughter&#x2019;s innocence. But does she really know her anymore? Meanwhile, Kent has questions of his own. His gut tells him that this is a case of an addict killing for drugs, but as he gets to know Barbara, he begins to hope he&#x2019;s wrong about Emily. The panic level rises as the mysteries intensify: Did Emily&#x2019;s obsession with drugs lead her to commit murder&#x2014;or is she another victim of a cold-blooded killer?</p></p><p><p>Terri Blackstock has sold over seven million books worldwide and is a <em>New York Times</em> and <em>USA TODAY</em> bestselling author.

When the interventionist is found dead and the teen is missing, mother Barbara Covington tries to find her daughter before police can arrest the girl for murder. Short chapters and terse dialogue propel the fast-paced action. It's competent genre work, though the characterizations could go deeper. The villain is somewhat improbable, and the 14-year-old brother of the missing teen is exceptionally clever and poised. But the mother-daughter relationship strikes true emotional notes; the redemptive arc of evangelical Christian fiction is natural and resonant in a story of addiction. Blackstock's many fans will be pleased, and this story will also speak to families dealing with addicted children. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

When her first short-story collection was published in 1941, it heralded the arrival of a genuinely original writer who over the decades wrote hugely popular novels, novellas, essays, and a memoir, One Writer's Beginnings, that became a national bestseller. By the end of her life, Welty (who died in 2001) had been given nearly every literary award there was and was all but shrouded in admiration. <br><br>In this definitive and authoritative account, Suzanne Marrs restores Welty's story to human proportions, tracing Welty's life from her roots in Jackson, Mississippi, to her rise to international stature. Making generous use of Welty's correspondence-particularly with contemporaries and admirers, including Katherine Anne Porter, E. M. Forster, and Elizabeth Bowen-Marrs has provided a fitting and fascinating tribute to one of the finest writers of the twentieth century. <br></p><p>Published in hardcover by Harcourt, 2005, 0-15-100914-7<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Honored for both her literary output and her generous spirit, Eudora Welty was probably the best loved writer in America. To read this biography is to understand why."--<i>The Plain Dealer</i> (Cleveland) &nbsp;Eudora Welty created some of the finest short fiction ever written. First published in the 1940s, her stories introduced a genuinely original voice, and by the time of her death in 2001 she had received nearly every literary award possible, including the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. To many she was not just a writer but an icon.<br>The Eudora Welty who emerges in this affectionate biography is not the sequestered spinster she was once thought to be but an inveterate traveler and a shrewd observer of her times. Suzanne Marrs, who shared a close friendship with Welty in her later years, makes effective use of the material to which she was given access, including letters to and from the two great loves of Welty's life and correspondence with contemporaries such as&nbsp;Katherine Anne Porter, E. M. Forster, and Elizabeth Bowen. The result is a complete and absorbing portrait of a woman and a writer passionately engaged with her world.&nbsp;"Ms. Marrs embraces Welty's own largely joyous take on her life even while probing its difficulties and disappointments."--<i>The Wall Street Journal</i> &nbsp;"In Suzanne Marrs, Eudora Welty has a responsible and thorough biographer who looked back, with a smile to be sure, but with a steady understanding as well." -- <i>The Times-Picayune</i> (New Orleans)&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Suzanne Marrs</b> is the author of <i>One Writer's Imagination: The Fiction of Eudora Welty</i> and a recipient of the Phoenix Award for Distinguished Welty Scholarship.

My heels echo off the marble floor as I race down the corridor past the row of brightly colored flags, the tall glass windows revealing smokers huddled under umbrellas in the courtyard. A display of student artwork left over from Black History Month decorates the otherwise drab white walls.</p><p>I reach the elevators and press the up button. In an office across the hall, two jacketless, gray-haired men wearing identical brown ties lean over a cubicle divider discussing Cuba, their voices dispassionate and unhurried. A dying fluorescent lightbulb flickers angrily in the ceiling fixture above them. I turn back and press the button several more times, tapping my foot. The smell of scorched coffee, an empty pot left too long on the burner, hangs in the air. The door creaks open and I leap into the elevator, swiping my badge in front of the access scanner before pressing the button. Don't stop, I pray, leaning sideways against the faux wood paneling and watching the numbers light up as the elevator slowly rises.</p><p>A minute later, the door opens. I step out, then pause, momentarily forgetting my haste. August and imposing, the executive floor is worlds away from the bureaucratic lethargy below. Oil paintings of every secretary of state since Jefferson line the tastefully lit beige walls, staring down at me sternly, reminding me to stand straight. Large potted plants sit to either side of the elevator bank.</p><p>Steeling myself for the conversation I am about to have, I turn away from the closed double doors that lead to the Secretary's office, following the chronological progression of gold-framed portraits down the navy-carpeted hallway. At John Calhoun, I stop and adjust my collar before turning the knob of a familiar, broad oak door.</p><p>"Hello, Patty," I say, entering the office and passing through the reception area before the stout, auburn-haired secretary can try to stop me. I knock twice on an unmarked door at the far end of the room, then open it without waiting.</p><p>"I want London," I announce.</p><p>Behind the massive oak desk, Paul Van Antwerpen looks up from the cable he was reading and blinks once behind his glasses.</p><p>"Oh?" he replies, raising his eyebrows and running his hand through his thinning hair.</p><p>I hesitate. For the normally impassive Van Antwerpen, this is quite a reaction. He is surprised, I can tell, by the abruptness of my entrance as well as the nature of my request. The senior director of intelligence operations is a formal man; one schedules appointments to see him and does so sparingly.</p><p>"Yes," I croak at last.</p><p>He gestures with his head to the two chairs opposite his desk. "Sit down."</p><p>I perch on the chair closest to the door. The office is immaculate as always, the desk bare except for a few tidy stacks of documents, the walls adorned only by the obligatory photographs of the President and Secretary of State. On the matching credenza behind his desk sits a telephone with direct lines to the Secretary and the National Security Advisor. Encrypted text, providing real-timeupdates on intelligence situations worldwide, scrolls down a computer screen.</p><p>I smooth my skirt. "Sir, I know we had an agreement..."</p><p>"<i>Have</i> an agreement," he corrects. "One year."</p><p>"Yes." A year hadn't sounded that bad when the Director proposed it. Of course I was in the hospital at the time, two days out of Liberia, ten hours out of surgery, and so high on painkillers I scarcely remember his visit. Now, eight months later, a year seems like an eternity, indentured servitude. Not that working for the Director is exactly punishment; as his liaison to the National Security Council, I've spent my days shuttling between meetings at Foggy Bottom and the White House. I've gained a view of foreign policy at the highest levels of government, and I've seen things most people could not imagine in a lifetime. But I have to get out of here now.</p><p>And he's going to say no.</p><p>The Director, one of the only people who can still get away with smoking in the building, reaches for the humidor that sits on the far right corner of his desk. I fight the urge to grimace as he clips the end of a cigar and lights it.</p><p>"Don't get me wrong," he says at last, puffing a cloud of smoke away from me. "I didn't really think I would be able to keep you here a full year. I've had five calls about you in the last month alone. Karachi, Jakarta, Montenegro, Lagos, Bogota, all of the garden spots."</p><p>I smile inwardly. "Garden spots" is a facetious term diplomats used to describe the real hardship posts. Those are the most interesting assignments and until now, I always sought them out, proud to say I had never been stationed in a place where one could actually drink the tap water.</p><p>"And now you're asking me," he pauses, "for London...? " He sets the cigar in an empty glass ashtray behind one of the stacks, then pulls a file with my name typed across the top from his desk drawer. My stomach twitches. I didn'tknow he kept a dossier on me. "You've turned down London two, no, three times before. You don't even like changing planes there." He sets the file down, eyes me levelly. "So what gives?"</p><p>I avert my gaze, staring over Van Antwerpen's shoulder and out the window behind his desk. To the far left, I can just make out the Washington Monument in the distance, the pale stone obelisk muted against the gray sky. I swallow hard and shift in my seat. "It's personal."</p><p>I watch him hesitate, uncertain how to respond. Normally, such an explanation would be unacceptable. As intelligence officers, we are trained to separate our work and personal lives, almost to the point of forgoing the latter. But I've earned my stripes, spent nearly the past ten years putting my life on the line. He'll feel that he owes me this much. He has to feel that way; I am counting on it.</p><p>"If you'd prefer, I can take a leave of absence..." I begin, but the Director waves his hand.</p><p>"No, they'd kill me if I let you do that. You can have London. Martindale," he pronounces the name as though it hurts his throat, "will be glad to have you. She tried to steal you away from me months ago."</p><p>I smile, picturing Maureen Martindale, the vivacious, red-haired deputy chief of mission in London and Van Antwerpen's longtime rival. I haven't seen Mo in three years, not since we worked together in San Salvador. My next move would have been to call her, if the Director refused my request. He closes the file. "We're all set then. Just give me a few weeks to get the paperwork in order."</p><p>I take a deep breath. "I'm sorry, sir, that won't work. I need to get over there immediately. Tonight, if possible. Tomorrow at the latest." I know that I am pushing the envelope, risking his wrath by asking too much. "I'll buy my own plane ticket and use vacation time until the paperwork comes through. If it's a question of my projects here, I'll finish up remotely, help find my replacement..." The desperation in my voice grows.</p><p>Van Antwerpen is staring at me now, eyes skeptical. "What's wrong, Weiss?"</p><p>I hesitate. It is a question I no longer know how to answer. "Nothing, sir," I lie at last.</p><p>"If you say so." I can tell from his tone that he does not believe me, but I know he will not pry further. Paul Van Antwerpen is an extraordinarily distant man. In the years I have worked for him, I've never learned where he is from or whether he even has a family, and he affords his officers the same kind of privacy. His standoffish nature bothered me in the early years when I mistook it for disapproval. Now I just accept it as part of who he is, like the Coke-bottle glasses and the cigars. He stands up, extending his hand. "Good luck, Weiss. Whatever it is, I hope it works out."</p><p>So do I. "Thank you, sir."</p><p>Two hours later, I climb into the back of a battered navy blue taxi. "Arlington, please. Columbia Pike," I request, pulling the door closed behind me. The taxi driver grunts and veers the car away from the curb onto the rain-soaked street. Garbled Indian music plays over the radio. I slump back against the torn vinyl seat, exhausted. The reality of what I've done crashes down on me like a wave.</p><p>England.</p><p>The cab lurches to a sudden stop as the traffic light at Virginia Avenue turns from yellow to red, sending the small cardboard box of personal belongings I was balancing on my knees to the floor. I bend to pick up the contents. Not much to it: a "Solidarity" coffee mug given to me by Kasia, one of our Foreign Service nationals in Warsaw, as a going-away present; a few reports that I need to finish up in London that I cannot entrust to the diplomatic pouch; a wood-framedpicture of my parents. I lift the photograph from the box, studying it. They are standing by the old maple tree in the backyard of our home in Vermont with identical burgundy wool sweaters tossed over their shoulders, looking like they stepped out of a J.Crew catalog. I run my finger over the glass. My mother's hair, dark and curly like mine, is streaked with more gray than I remember. There won't be time to see them before I leave. I know, though, that they have come to accept my abrupt, unannounced departures, the weeks and sometimes months without communication that my work necessitates. They will understand, or pretend to anyway, I think, gratitude mixing with guilt. They deserve grandchildren, or at least a daughter who calls before moving out of the country.</p><p>As the taxi climbs the Roosevelt Bridge toward Arlington, I sit back and reach into my coat pocket for my cell phone. For a moment I consider following protocol for once and going through the State Department travel office for my plane ticket. Then, deciding against it, I dial zero. "British Airways," I request. The operator promptly transfers me to a prerecorded message of a woman's voice with an English accent asking me to hold for the next available representative, followed by a Muzak version of Chopin's Polonaise.</p><p>On hold, I lean sideways and press my forehead against the cool glass window, st...</p></p><h2>Reading The Red Book: An Interpretive Guide to C.G.

Every morning, I head over to the Hudson River Park for fresh air and a run (just found out the exhaust fumes of the West Side Highway could kill me more quickly than lack of exercise, go figure), and I became obsessed with a woman living on one of the last small buildings facing the river amidst the &#x201c;progress&#x201d; of glamorous high-rises and hotels. I&#x2019;d wonder, &#x201c;Why does she stay?&#x201d; Most summer mornings she was in her housecoat tending to tomato plants that line the fence of her rooftop. I never waved or rang her bell, but I connected to her. She reminded me of my grandmothers, who had their own gardens, and for most of their widowed lives, lived alone. I began to look for the woman, and when I saw her, I felt relieved, as though life wasn&#x2019;t really racing by, and that the past was somehow, in the form of this lady, still alive.</p><p> This lady, whose name I do not know and whom I have never met, brought me to the story of Carlo Bonicelli, my grandfather, a shoemaker. I keep a photograph of him on my desk to remind me of the artisans that came before me. (It&#x2019;s a crowded desktop; those of you who read <i>Lucia, Lucia</i> know about the seamstresses in my family!) </p><p> My grandfather Carlo died when he was thirty-nine years old. My grandmother told me that while he repaired shoes and built them, his dream was to design them. He did not live long enough to see his dream materialize. With my grandmother gone, I asked my mother about him, about his work. This wasn&#x2019;t easy, as my mom cries whenever she talks about her father. As those of you dutiful children out there know, when our mothers cry, it&#x2019;s like somebody&#x2019;s plunging a knife into our chests. But this time, I asked her not to cry, and she told me the story of the Bonicelli shoes. Then I went to Italy with my dear pal Gina Casella, (with our five-year-old daughters in tow) to learn how to make shoes. I met a few of the great artisans, who became the inspiration for the shoemakers in this novel. </p><p> The trip changed my creative life, but it also changed the substance and course of this story. I come from people who survived by the labor of their own hands in a glorious country of their choice (our United States). I always knew this, but now I <i>understand</i> it. I only live as an artist because they gave me their stories, and because you read them. So, Dear Reader (love it--so Jane Austen!), <i>Very Valentine</i> is for you. It&#x2019;s about all of us: our family dynamics, our dreams, our luck or lack of it in matters of the heart, and how we negotiate going forward, in a world that&#x2019;s moving so fast, even a stroll is now a blur. This is the first of three books about Valentine Roncalli and her family of shoemakers. When I wrote it, I wanted to bring you old world craftsmanship, the magical setting of Greenwich Village, in a contemporary family saga told in vivid detail. I hope you enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>Beloved by millions of readers around the world for her "dazzling" novels, (USA Today) Adriana Trigiani is &#x201c;a master of palpable and visual detail&#x201d; (Washington Post) and &#x201c;a comedy writer with a heart of gold&#x201d; (New York Times).

They were soldiers, officials, businessmen, doctors and missionaries of both sexes, planters, engineers and many others, together with children, wives and sisters. This book describes their lives, their work and their extraordinarily varied interactions with the native populations; it also records the very diverse roles they played in the three centuries of British-Indian history. Gilmour writes of people who have never been written about before, men and women who are presented here with humanity and often with humour. The result is a magnificent tapestry of life, an exceptional work of scholarly recovery which reads like a great nineteenth-century novel. It makes a highly original and engaging contribution to a long an important period of British and Indian history.</p><p>David Gilmour is one of Britain's most admired and accomplished historical writers and biographers.

His acclaimed book <i>The Temple in the House</i> showed how to and the sacred in architecture. Now, in <b>A Home for the Soul,</b> he reveals how our houses and apartments can become havens of inspiration and renewal.<br><br>"From the moment we're born, we seek to find home." Lawlor says, "Yet, despite this primal longing, our dwelling places often disappoint us." In <b>A Home for the Soul</b>, we discover that the depth and meaning we seek is right in front of us if we but have the eyes to see. Lawlor teaches us how to develop a consciousness about the spiritual possibilities inherent in our interior surroundings; he shows how to recognize the sacred in material form. "Each time we bathe," says Lawlor, "we not only cleanse the body, we refresh the spirit. Each time we open our front door, we enter a universe of connection and signifcance."<br><br>Lawlor leads us on a journey through each room of the house, opening our vision to hidden possibilities. We discover, for example, how a stove expresses the transforming power of nature, how clothes closets reveal our inner personalities, and how home of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ces display our talents. Lawlor shows us the mythological and archetypal meanings within the common objects of daily life--such as a bed, a bathtub, a pair of shoes, or a loaf or bread.<br><br>The author also offers practical suggestions for arranging or building soulful homes. He explains how to use wood, tile, brick, and stone to express qualities of the spirit and how to use furniture and personal objects as allies in creating meaning.<br><br>Finally, Lawlor shows us how to construct a Mandala of the Soul--a wood cabinet with compartments for housing the symbols of home that have particular personal meanings for each reader.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In these pages, we come to understand how all the rooms we live in can form a sacred place of wholeness, a home that cares for and uplifts the totality of mind, body, and soul.</p><p><i>Mindfulness</i> has become a common religious buzzword. In <i>A Home for the Soul</i> award-winning architect Anthony Lawlor shows us how to decorate a home that encourages mindfulness from every bathroom and bibelot. Despite a (perhaps unavoidable) tendency toward camp and solipsism, the stunning photographs and insights into the potentially sacred details of domestic living prompt you to pay closer attention to your immediate environment. For example, "Books are like small altars, each page serving as a threshold for crossing into realms of broadened vision." Investing the items around us with soulful symbolism is like living in a temple of one's own design."In places and people, we seek that elusive feeling of being welcomed. We want our houses and apartments to be warm and nurturing and beautiful, but they are sometimes territories of chaos and confusion. Yet, the haven the soul seeks is close at hand, within the stove and the cupboard, on the bookshelf, and in the closet. With the eyes to see it, and the hands to create it, we can recover the home that the soul desires."<br>--from the introduction of A Home for the Soul<br>Praise for The Temple in the House<br><br>"What a rare, important, and beautiful book. It has style, substance, art, depth, and usefulness. I treasure it."<br>--Thomas Moore, author of Care of the Soul<br><br>"This book is a living temple in which the soul of architecture and the architecture of the soul are brilliantly evoked. The reader is magically led through patterns and proportions that transform the ordinary house into a charged place of spirit."<br>--Jean Houston, Ph.D., author of A Mythic Life<br><br>"The Temple in the House guides the reader to discover the roots of design in the heart and mind, and helps us understand how to translate these symbols and sentiments into spaces that make us happy and healthy. A wonderful book."<br>--James A. Swan, Ph.D., author of Nature as Teacher</p><h2>Garri Potter I Filofskij Kamen = Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone (Russian Edition)</h2><p>Finally in a Russian translation, the first book in the Harry Potter series (Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone ).</p><p></p><h2>Unseen Mendieta: The Unpublished Works of Ana Mendieta</h2><p>Ana Mendieta (1948-1985) produced some of the most compelling images of body- and identity-oriented art of the 1970s. The tracks made by the artist dragging her blood-covered arms down a wall; the pigment-filled void of her silhouette pressed into a sandy beach, consumed by advancing waves; her bodily outline drawn by ignited gunpowder on the earth or set alight with fireworks against the night sky; and fetishistic goddess shapes molded in soil, adorned with flowers, resound in the histories of feminist art, performance and land art, and late twentieth-century Latin American art.<br>Despite major survey exhibitions by museums in the United States, Europe, and Latin America over the last decade, however, a large body of work by Mendieta remains unknown. Hundreds of 35 mm slides in the artist's personal archive, including many that document her extensive Silueta series - her signature "earth-body works" created in the landscapes of Mexico, Iowa, upstate New York, and Cuba between 1973 and 1981 - remain unpublished and are unknown even to the most knowledgeable of contemporary art scholars. In addition to the slide works published in this volume for the first time, there are selections from her many black-and-white photographic negatives and contact sheets, documenting unknown sculptural works produced in the early 1980s, as well as revealing pages from the artist's diaristic sketchbooks.</p><p>OLGA VISO served as director of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, D.C. before being named director of the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in 2008. She is the author of several books on contemporary Latin American art. She lives in Minneapolis, MN.BStarred Review. Multimedia pioneer Ana Mendieta (1948-1985) broke taboos and exploded the boundaries of fine art at every turn of her short career; sadly, her sudden death at 36 left her unorganized oeuvre in the hands of a distraught family and a few dedicated scholars. This book of previously unseen work, the result of years of research and cataloging by Mendieta authority Viso, is a must-have for fans. For those unfamiliar with her shocking and vibrant work, this is a fantastic introduction to Mendieta's demanding exploration of violence, the body, religion and the natural world. Characteristic, and perhaps the most disturbing, of her pieces, is Rape Scene, part of a series inspired by real events: "workshop participants invited to visit her apartment at a prearranged time... discovered her apartment door ajar. Inside the artist was posed silently, doubled over a table in a pool of blood with implements of violence scattered about." Working in public venues and frequently using her own body (or her blood) as a medium, Mendieta attempts to blaze a new path with every series of images: "My works do not belong to the modernist tradition... nor to the commercially historical-self-conscious assertions of what is called post-modernism." The accompanying text by Viso provides informative biographical information, as well as valuable interpretation and analysis. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kushner offers his words of Torah with a conversational enthusiasm that ranges from family dynamics to the Kabbalah; Mamet challenges the reader, often beginning his comment far afield&#x2014;with Freud or the American judiciary&#x2014;before returning to a text now wholly reinterpreted.<br><br>In the tradition of Israel as a people who wrestle with God, Kushner and Mamet grapple with the biblical text, succumbing neither to apologetics nor parochialism, asking questions without fear of the answers they may find. Over the course of a year of weekly readings, they comment on all aspects of the Bible: its richness of theme and language, its contradictions, its commandments, and its often unfathomable demands. If you are already familiar with the Bible, this book will draw you back to the text for a deeper look. If you have not yet explored the Bible in depth, Kushner and Mamet are guides of unparalleled wisdom and discernment. Five Cities of Refuge is easily accessible yet powerfully illuminating.

The great fire of the Second World War has convulsed Europe and Asia. In its wake, Aldred Leith, an acclaimed hero of the conflict, has spent two years in China at work on an account of world-transforming change there. Son of a famed and sexually ruthless novelist, Leith begins to resist his own self-sufficiency nurtured by war. Peter Exley, another veteran and an art historian by training, is prosecuting war crimes committed by the Japanese. Both men have narrowly escaped death in battle, and Leith saved Exley's life. The men have maintained long-distance friendship in a postwar loneliness that haunts them both, and which has swallowed Exley whole. Now in their thirties, with their youth behind them and their world in ruins, both must invent the future and retrieve a private humanity.<br><br>Arriving in Occupied Japan to record the effects of the bomb in Hiroshima, Leith meets Benedict and Helen Driscoll, the Australian son and daughter of a tyrannical medical administrator. Benedict, at twenty, is doomed by a rare degenerative disease. Helen, still younger, is inseparable from her brother. Precocious, brilliant, sensitive, at home in the books they read together, these two have been, in Leith's words, delivered by literature. The young people capture Leith's sympathy; indeed, he finds himself struggling with his attraction to this girl whose feelings are as intense as his own and from whom he will soon be fatefully parted.<br><br>A deeply observed story of love and separation, of disillusion and recovered humanity, <i>The Great Fire</i> marks the much-awaited return to fiction of an author whose novel <i>The Transit of Venus</i> won the National Book Critics Circle Award and, twenty years after its publication, is considered a modern classic.<br></p><p>"<i>The Great Fire</i> is a brilliant, brave, and sublimely written novel that allows the literate reader 'the consolation of having touched infinity.'

Torrell traces the fate of Aquinas's Summa from its slow start, through the eventual emergence of Thomism, and finally to its widespread acceptance. The nineteenth and twentieth centuries witnessed the ultimate triumph of Aquinas's work with the encyclical Aeternis patris and, in the wake of Vatican II there has been renewed interest in its content and method. </p><p>This book is a masterpiece of concision and completeness.

The glimmer and shafts of diffused light that stream into the courtyards and curtained rooms add to the romantic atmosphere&#x2014;one feels as though they have entered into a quintessential Turbeville photograph. Turbeville has captured the spiritual nature of Mexican culture by incorporating into candlelit interiors such traditional religious artifacts as colorful painted tin retablos, hand-carved saints, wooden tableau boxes, and a central wooden figure of the local Virgin Saint Maria Candelaria: aged objets that are handmade, tell stories, and are arranged in artful vignettes. Casa No Name speaks of magic realism and beckons the reader into the private world of this visionary artist.

The sprawling, dramatic tale of the legendary warrior C� Chulainn and his battle against the invading army of Connacht over the fabled Brown Bull of Cooley, The T�in is an enthralling epic of heroism, magic, bloodshed, and betrayal. The wellspring of Irish literature from Yeats to Joyce, The T�in is the story of the emergence of a hero with superhuman strength and supernatural powers. It is a paean to the Irish landscape and a bawdy and contentious marital farce. Filled with phenomenal battle scenes of hand-to-hand combat and clashes between massive armies, C� Chulainns heroic exploits contain the historical seeds of the struggle for Irish nationalism as well as the mythic roots of the traditional Irish love of nature. Carsons lively, conversational rendition of The T�in will bring the adventures of the legendary Irish hero to a new generation of readers interested in epic poetry and Irish history. In the first translation in forty years, Carson brings this seminal work of literature fully to life, capturing all the visceral power of the ancient epic. It is truly a classic for our time.</p><p><b>Ciaran Carson</b> is a poet, translator, novelist, and essayist who has written extensively on Irish history and mythology. His nine collections of poetry include a T. S. Eliot Prize winner. His translation of Dante�&#x2019;s <i>Inferno</i> was awarded the Oxford Weidenfeld Translation Prize.Loosely translated as The Cattle Raid of Cooley, the <i>T�in B� C�ailnge</i> is part of the 80-story, multiauthor Ulster Cycle, an Irish epic that dates to the eighth century. Rendered in laconic vernacular prose by veteran poet and translator Carson, <i>The T�in</i> (pronounced toyne) opens on the pillow talk of King Ailill of Connacht and his boastful wife, Queen Mebd. Reckoning that her husband has one greater asset than she, namely, the prize white-horned bull, Finnbennach, the queen enlists the entire army of Connacht to wage war against C�ailnge, a province of Ulster, in order to secure its fine brown bull. As the army moves into Ulster, it is led by Fergus, a former king of Ulster now in exile who remains sympathetic to the Ulster side and to his 17-year-old foster son, C� Chulainn, whose youthful exploits Fergus recounts. Three-day hand-to-hand combat pits C� Chulainn against his beloved foster-brother, Fer Diad Mac Dam�in; at the climax, the white and brown bulls come face to face. The narrative revels in place names and their etymologies, telling story upon story. Carson's version is a lively and vivid journey through a mythic landscape. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Dworkin ( Letters from a War Zone ), who lobbies for municipal statutes declaring pornography a violation of women's civil rights, insists that pornography links sex and violence by incorporating violent domination of women as a key element of sexual fantasy: "Force in high-class pornography is romanticized . . . as if it were dance." Dworkin also takes what many consider to be an extreme position; she believes that pornography incites men to sexual violence. To support her thesis, she draws parallels between the life and writings of the Marquis de Sade and provides critical summaries of several contemporary pornographic works. Dworkin's style is intense, vivid and eloquent, infused with a sense of urgency. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Lions of the Desert (Egypt Trilogy #2)</h2><p>Lions of the Desert opens up in 1915, over a year after the conclusion of Arabian Winds.

For too long she had let herself languish on the shelf in the game of love, refusing to open herself up to renewed heartbreak. But it was past time to reenter the lists.<br><br>Admittedly, in Mr. Hennessy she was drawn by both curiosity and the lure of the forbidden. She knew better, of course. A proper lady did not indulge in scandalous experiments with libertine actors behind the stage curtains. Hennessy was known as something of a Lothario among the London theater crowd, although in addition to being a brilliant performer, he was also a successful manager of his own troupe, a budding playwright, and the talented director of Tess&#x2019;s two recent benefit concerts, which had raised vast sums for her charities.<br><br>Then again, perhaps she was not giving him a fair chance.<br><br>Closing her eyes more tightly, Tess made a stronger effort to enter into the spirit of the kiss. In response, Hennessy&#x2019;s hand stole lower down her back, over her derri�re, to pull her closer. Despite her own lack of enthusiasm, she had evidently affected him, judging by the swelling hardness she felt pressing against her lower abdomen&#x2014;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, well, are you practicing to play the part of lovers in your production, Miss Blanchard?&#x201d;<br><br>At the sharp-edged drawl, a startled Tess tore her mouth away from Hennessy&#x2019;s&#x2014;and froze in mortification upon recognizing that sardonic male voice. Obviously she had failed to hear anyone enter the ballroom where their makeshift stage was erected.<br><br>Good Lord, what utterly dreadful timing, to have her transgression discovered by the arrogant, infuriating Duke of Rotham, elder cousin of her late betrothed. Rotham had stepped behind the stage curtains to find her locked in a clandestine embrace with the man she had hired to produce her amateur theatrical.<br><br>Scalding heat flooded Tess&#x2019;s cheeks as she pulled away from her partner in crime. Hennessy had also reacted to the duke&#x2019;s unexpected appearance by releasing her instantly. Yet the actor looked not only guilty but somewhat alarmed, as if he&#x2019;d been caught in a hanging offense.<br><br>Squaring her shoulders, Tess turned to face Ian Sutherland, the tall, lithe Duke of Rotham. His handsome face was an enigmatic mask in the muted daylight seeping over the stage curtains from the ballroom windows, but his mouth held a tightness that signified displeasure, perhaps even anger.<br><br>He had no right to judge her, she told herself defiantly.<br><br>&#x201c;You are mistaken, your grace,&#x201d; Tess said, striving to keep her voice calm as she responded to his mocking tone. &#x201c;There are no lovers in Mr. Hennessy&#x2019;s play. It is merely a comedy of manners about a mischievous ghost.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You were testing out a new role, then?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What may I do for you, Rotham?&#x201d; Tess asked, ignoring his jibe. &#x201c;We have only just concluded the dress rehearsal and still have a great deal to accomplish before this evening&#x2019;s performance.&#x201d;<br><br>They had constructed a stage at one end of the ballroom of her godmother&#x2019;s country mansion for the theatrical&#x2014;the crowning entertainment of the charitable benefit Tess had organized. Tess had engaged Hennessy and his troupe to put on the one-act play and direct the houseguests in their respective acting roles.<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt your preparations entail kissing the hired help,&#x201d; Rotham drawled in that annoyingly cynical tone of his.<br><br>Tess stiffened. &#x201c;It is hardly any of your business whom I kiss, your grace.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I beg to differ.&#x201d;<br><br>Renewed ire rose in Tess. She would not allow him to dictate to her, as he was regularly fond of doing. Indeed, they had had similar arguments before. The Duke of Rotham was head of the family she would have married into had her betrothed not tragically perished two years ago at the Battle of Waterloo. But they had no real blood ties, and Rotham was mistaken in thinking that he had any say over her affairs. Particularly her amorous affairs.<br><br>Shifting his attention, Rotham turned his piercing gray gaze on Mr. Hennessy, who still seemed wary and on edge. &#x201c;I expected better of you, Hennessy. You were supposed to be protecting her, not assaulting her. Is this how you fulfill your duties?&#x201d;<br><br>The actor shot the duke a chagrined look of apology. &#x201c;I beg your forgiveness, your grace. I fell down in my duties disgracefully.&#x201d; Rather sheepishly, he turned to Tess. &#x201c;A thousand pardons, Miss Blanchard. I was vastly out of line.&#x201d;<br><br>Tess started to respond, but Rotham interrupted her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll thank you to leave us, Hennessy. I shall deal with you later.&#x201d;<br><br>Her jaw dropped at Rotham&#x2019;s arrogant dismissal, but before she could voice her objection aloud, Hennessy gave her a brief bow, then pivoted with alacrity and disappeared through a part in the curtains.<br><br>She remained speechless as she listened to him bound down the stage steps and hurry away across the ballroom. It was hardly chivalrous of him to abandon her to the mercies of the duke, Tess thought resentfully. No doubt he preferred not to challenge a nobleman of Rotham&#x2019;s station and far-reaching influence.<br><br>However, when she at last gathered her wits enough to protest, Rotham held up an imperious hand, forestalling her. &#x201c;You should know better than to indulge in trysts with libertines such as Hennessy.&#x201d;<br><br>Prickling with indignation, Tess returned a mutinous look. The nerve of him, scolding her for a sin she had not even committed. &#x201c;I was not indulging in any tryst, your grace. It was just a simple kiss.&#x201d;<br><br>The corner of Rotham&#x2019;s mouth curled. &#x201c;It did not look at all simple to me. You were participating fully.&#x201d;<br><br>He sounded almost angry, although why he would be angry with her for returning the actor&#x2019;s kiss, she couldn&#x2019;t fathom.<br><br>&#x201c;What if I was participating? It is no crime&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>Realizing how high-pitched and flustered her own voice sounded, Tess took a calming breath and forced a cool smile. &#x201c;I truly cannot believe your gall, Rotham. How someone of your wicked character can deride another man for rakish behavior&#x2014;or criti- cize me for something so innocent as a mere kiss&#x2014;is the height of irony. Do you even recognize your hypocrisy?&#x201d;<br><br>A hint of satirical amusement tugged at his lips. &#x201c;I acknowledge your point, Miss Blanchard. But I am not the only one concerned about your relationship with Hennessy. Lady Wingate is worried that you have become overly attached to him. In fact, she sent me to find you.&#x201d;<br><br>That gave Tess pause, as doubtless Rotham knew it would. Baroness Wingate was not just Tess&#x2019;s godmother but chief patron for her various charities. She could not afford to offend the noblewoman whose generosity impacted so many lives for the better.<br><br>&#x201c;I have not become attached to Hennessy in the least,&#x201d; Tess finally replied. &#x201c;He is a valued employee, nothing more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you make a habit of kissing all your employees?&#x201d; Rotham taunted. Before she could reply, he shook his head in reproach. &#x201c;Lady Wingate will be severely disappointed in you. She arranged a lavish house party solely for your sake, so you could dun her guests for your assorted charities. And this is how you repay her?&#x201d;<br><br>Unable to refute the charge, Tess regarded Rotham in frustration. Her godmother had long disapproved of her endeavors to promote her charitable organizations and had only recently relented and invited some four dozen wealthy guests to a weeklong house party, thereby providing Tess with a captive audience. She&#x2019;d spent the past week attempting to persuade each one of them to contribute to her causes.<br><br>&#x201c;Do you mean to tattle to her?&#x201d; she asked Rotham.<br><br>His answer, rife with mocking humor, disturbed her. &#x201c;That depends.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;On whether or not you intend to continue your liaison with Hennessy.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I tell you, I am not having a liaison with him! You have completely misconstrued the matter.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who initiated the kiss?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does that matter?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If Hennessy took advantage of you, I will have to call him out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You cannot be serious!&#x201d; Tess stared at him, appalled to think he might not be jesting. The last Duke of Rotham, Laurence Sutherland, had ended his licentious career when he was killed in a duel over a married woman by her jealous husband. His son Ian had followed a similar reckless path all through his youth, generating wild tales of gambling and womanizing. Ian Sutherland&#x2019;s scandalous endeavors had earned him the nickname &#x201c;the Devil Duke&#x201d; when he came into the title eight years ago. But surely he would not actually shoot Hennessy for the mere act of kissing her.<br><br>&#x201c;You know very well that dueling is illegal,&#x201d; Tess objected, &#x201c;in addition to being dangerous and possibly even lethal.&#x201d;<br><br>Rotham&#x2019;s mouth tightened again, as if he too had recalled his sire&#x2019;s ignominious end. &#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d;<br><br>When he said nothing further, Tess suddenly recalled the confusing remark he&#x2019;d made before ordering the actor from the ballroom. &#x201c;What did you mean when you said Mr. Hennessy should have been &#x2018;protecting&#x2019; me?&#x201d;<br><br>Rotham waved a careless hand in dismissal. &#x201c;It is of no import.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I should like to know.&#x201d; Tess fixed him with a stubborn gaze, determined not to back down.<br><br>He must have sensed her resolve, for he gave a shrug of his broad shoulders. &#x201c;When you began spending so much time at the Theatre Royal in Covent Garden in preparation for your last charity event, I charged Hennessy with keeping an eye on you. The theater district is a dangerous area, especially for an unescorted young lady.&#x201d;<br><br>Her eyebrows lifted in puzzlement. &#x201c;So you asked him to look after me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I paid him a significant sum, in fact.&#x201d;<br><br>So that explained why Hennessy always insisted on escorting her to and from her carriage, Tess realized, and why he had hovered around her whenever she attended rehearsals. She had thought it was because the actor was growing enamored of her company. Irrationally, she couldn&#x2019;t help feeling a prick to her self-esteem.<br><br>&#x201c;My companion usually accompanies me to the theater,&#x201d; she pointed out to Rotham.<br><br>&#x201c;Your companion is an aging spinster with all the substance of a butterfly. She would be no help whatsoever if you were confronted by trouble.&#x201d;<br><br>That much was true, Tess conceded. Mrs. Dorothy Croft was tiny and gentle and soft-spoken, in addition to being a bit scatterbrained. The impoverished friend of Tess&#x2019;s late mother, Dorothy had needed somewhere to live after being widowed, so Tess had opened her home in Chiswick to her. The relation- ship had also benefited Tess. With a genteel, elderly lady to lend her single state respectability, she had much more freedom to conduct her charitable endeavors.<br><br>&#x201c;I have a sturdy coachman and footmen to provide me protection should I require it,&#x201d; Tess argued.<br><br>Rotham&#x2019;s vivid gray gaze never faltered. &#x201c;Even so, I thought it wise to ensure your safety. And you would not readily have accepted any edicts from me.&#x201d;<br><br>That was also certainly true. They had long been at odds&#x2014;which is what made Rotham&#x2019;s current interest in her safety so startling. That he might be seriously concerned for her welfare had never crossed her mind.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you needn&#x2019;t worry about me, your grace. I am capable of providing for my own protection.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then you should refrain from kissing the likes of Hennessy. And he had best keep away from you. If he dares to touch you again, he will answer to me.&#x201d;<br><br>At the edge of possessiveness in the duke&#x2019;s tone, Tess&#x2019;s eyebrows narrowed in disbelief. He could not possibly be jealous. No doubt he was merely angry at Hennessy for disobeying a direct order, and at her for daring to contradict him.<br><br>&#x201c;Your transgressions are a thousand times worse, Rotham.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But I am not an unmarried young lady, as you are.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I am not so young any more,&#x201d; Tess rejoined.<br><br>Instead of replying, Rotham hesitated, as if suddenly aware how sharp his tone had become. Shaking his head, he seemed visibly to repress his emotions, as if distancing himself from their argument.<br><br>His succeeding laugh was soft and laced with real amusement. &#x201c;You are hardly ancient, Miss Blanchard. You only just turned twenty-three today.&#x201d;<br><br>Tess eyed him with suspicion. &#x201c;How did you know it was my birthday?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As head of the family, it is my business to know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are not head of my family.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For all practical purposes, I am.&#x201d;<br><br>There it was again, that ironic drawl that convinced her he was deliberately attempting to provoke her.<br><br>It was infuriating, how Rotham always seemed to get under her skin, Tess reflected. Particularly when she was normally serene and even-tempered.<br><br>She had always thought him vexing&#x2014;and deplorably fascinating. Rotham not only had a wicked reputation, he even looked wicked. He had striking gray eyes fringed by dark lashes, with lean, aristocratic features that were handsome as sin. His hair was a rich brown shot with gold threads, several shades lighter than her own sable hue, and held a slight curl. He possessed the muscular build of a sportsman, but with a lethal elegance that proclaimed his nobility.<br><br>Yet it was Rotham&#x2019;s powerful personality that made him utterly unforgettable.<br><br>At the moment his features were mainly in shadow, since it was barely noon on a dreary, rainy autumn day and they were shrouded by stage curtains. Yet he still had the strange ability to affect her, Tess acknowledged.<br><br>She&#x2019;d felt that same magnetic allure the first moment of meeting Rotham during her comeout four Seasons ago, when he&#x2019;d deigned to dance with her. But shortly afterward, she&#x2019;d fallen in love with his younger cousin Richard.<br><br>Ever since, she had felt guilty for her forbidden attraction to the Duke of Rotham. He was every inch the fallen angel. And lamentably even now, she felt his hypnotic pull as his gray gaze bored into her. . . .<br><br>In an effort to break the spell, Tess abruptly changed the subject. &#x201c;What are you even doing at this house party, Rotham? You never attend my functions, even when you are invited.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Lady Wingate requested my presence for your birthday celebration this evening.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So that is how you knew my age.

He provides a perceptive tour of the Hamptons, but the detailed comparison of building styles and discussion of the architects going back to the 17th century who have left an impact will primarily interest only specialists in the field. The abundant photos of breathtaking houses are arranged alphabetically by architect, a few of whom contribute their own perspectives on buildings in the area. The rarefied world of the Hamptons isn't a viable playland for all, but anyone can enjoy a visit via the pages of this showcase. <br>Copyright 1986 Reed Business Information, Inc.The purpose of this book is to examine some modern houses of distinction in the psychological backyard of New York City, the Hamptons, those affluent and sophisticated communities of eastern Long Island that are all too often used as "a pedestal on which to place striking objects." The recent creations of architects such as Gwathmey, Franzen, DeVido, Jaffe, and Stern are beautifully illustrated. Thirty-two firms in all are represented. Prefacing the photographs is an excellent long essay by Goldberger which surveys the architectural tradition from Shingle Style though International Style to the present "romantic modernism."

But when a tragic fire destroys their new house and shop, the family has to move into an abandoned shack, with cobwebs dangling from the rafters. Soon the shoemaker must sell his family's cherished decorations. But on Christmas morning, they all awaken to a shimmering surprise hanging from their tree.<br> Spun by the Christmas spirit, a wonderful magic weaves throughout this holiday tale.<br></p><p><b>ODDS BODKIN </b>is an acclaimed storyteller, composer, and teacher.

He lives in Texas. <br>Ages 4-8. In this poignant Christmas story set in "old Chicago," a "humble cobbler" and his family anticipate Christmas by admiring the one memento they saved from their old home in Germany--a box of beautiful glass ornaments. When a fire burns the cobbler's shop and home, the cobbler rescues only the box of ornaments, taking it with him when he resettles the family in a cobweb-strewn shack. Everyone tries to prepare for Christmas, but the cobbler must sell the ornaments to support the family, leaving the tree bare. The shack's story takes a magical turn when the spiders living in the shack weave beautiful decorations onto the tree, surprising and delighting the displaced family. The simple, well-written text is perfectly paced for quiet story hours, and the stylized, nicely composed paintings echo all the emotional drama. Children who have experienced or can imagine leaving behind the security of their own warm homes will connect with this moving offering, and parents will appreciate the message about materialism.

California Chardonnays now compete with French, and discriminating shoppers can now choose Mexican and Canadian reds in addition to their European counterparts. <em>The Oxford Companion to the Wines of North America</em> encompasses this fertile region's wine and winemaking with scope and authority, illuminating the major techniques, variations, and key players on the North American scene for the first time in one comprehensive volume. <br> The ultimate complement to <em>The Oxford Companion to Wine</em>--now in its second edition and praised by <em>The New York Times</em> as the "most complete compendium of wine knowledge assembled in modern times"--this new Companion objectively surveys the current state of American wine production, celebrating traditions and sensibilities unique to American vintages while highlighting the geographical, philosophical, and commercial variations that distinguish regional wines. General Editor Bruce Cass and world-renowned wine expert Jancis Robinson weave the knowledge of wine academics and writers from across America into a compelling set of introductory essays that distinguish features of North American wine and its history, followed by corresponding alphabetical entries that explore wine topics in depth. Although California dominates American production, wineries and local specialties from throughout North America receive balanced coverage within individual area, region, state, and country entries. Mondavi and Beringer are here, along with segments on Gold Seal winery of New York, Santo Tomas of Mexico, Stoney Ridge of Ontario, and many others. Curious wine tasters will also find reliable information on grape and resultant wine varieties, viticultural techniques, notable brands, and the most coveted wines. All technical terms are fully explained with helpful cross-references to Robinson's <em>Oxford Companion to Wine.</em> <br> Sure to become the classic book on American wine, <em>The Oxford Companion to the Wines of North America</em> is a masterpiece of scholarship with a dynamic flavor befitting its subject. Novices and connoisseurs alike will find it an irresistible resource.</p><p><br><strong>Bruce Cass</strong> brings years of internationally recognized expertise to this remarkable project. He has taught wine classes on the Stanford University campus since 1972, helped found the Society of Wine Educators, and was the editorial consultant for James Halliday's <em>Wine Atlas of California</em>, which won both the Julia Child and the James Beard awards as Best Wine Book of 1993. He is a respected wine judge in international competitions both at home and abroad. He lives in San Francisco, California, where he runs the non-profit Pacific Rim Wine Education Center. <strong> Jancis Robinson</strong> is one of the world's leading authorities on wine and the editor of the acclaimed <em>Oxford Companion to Wine.</em> Now in its second edition, this bestseller has won numerous awards, including the Cliquot Book of the Year, the James Beard Award, the Julia Child/ International Association of Culinary Professionals Award, and the Andr� Simon Memorial Award. The first British journalist to have passed the notoriously tough Master of Wine exams, she is now the wine columnist for the <em>Financial Times</em> and writes a regular column for publications in eleven countries on five continents, including <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>. She lives in London, England.<br>Following the second edition of <i>The Oxford Companion to Wine</i> (1999), a contributor, Cass, has edited a book on the wines of U.S., Canada, and Mexico. Not surprisingly, some of the cross-references in this book refer to the general volume.<p>The North American volume begins with 15 essays of three to five pages on a variety of topics, two written by Robinson and one by Cass. Other contributors to the essays and the text include professors, owners of wineries, a sommelier, and wine writers. Robinson, who is British, writes an evaluative essay on the quality of North American wine and believes "that the very best wines reach as high a level . . . as the best Europe can produce." An essay on trends and demographics notes that eight percent of the North American population drinks wine but they drink ten percent of the wine produced worldwide.</p><p>The <i>A-Z</i> entries take up about 75 percent of the book and are written by nine contributors, including Cass, whose writing is particularly lively and amusing. Describing Jack Cakebread as better known for his football photography, with winery finances supplied by the family auto body business, Cass writes that Cakebread winery has been "accorded artisan status rarely associated with football or with fender replacement." In addition to entries for wineries, geographic areas (counties, states, regions), organizations, wine terms and grape varieties, and people associated with viticulture are also mentioned. Although some of the entries are long and detailed (<i>California </i>is more than 10 pages long), references are not included. Four 4 page spreads of color photographs are interspersed with the text. Line-drawn maps of wine-growing regions of the U.S. are not very useful because they indicate only elevation, cities, rivers, and lakes.</p><p>Two pages of "classic" American foods with wine suggest a Colorado Chardonnay with alligator or Livermore Semillon with lima beans! The comprehensive, useful index lists names of U.S. wine licensees and American Viticultural Areas (as designated by the Wine Institute) as well as people, techniques, and so on that are mentioned in the text. In both the index and the Note to the Reader, Cass mentions that the ownership of wineries changes daily and the information is current as of spring 2000.</p><p><i>The Oxford Companion to the Wines of North America</i> stands alone as a current resource for wine enthusiasts. Used in conjunction with the second edition of <i>The Oxford Companion to Wine,</i> it will provide a comprehensive look at a popular and important industry in the U.S. Recommended for public and academic libraries with an interest in oenology.

Albert Einstein as a man, however, has been a much harder portrait to paint, and what we know of him as a husband, father, and friend is fragmentary at best. With <i>Einstein: His Life and Universe</i>, Walter Isaacson (author of the bestselling biographies <i>Benjamin Franklin</i> and <i>Kissinger</i>) brings Einstein's experience of life, love, and intellectual discovery into brilliant focus. The book is the first biography to tackle Einstein's enormous volume of personal correspondence that heretofore had been sealed from the public, and it's hard to imagine another book that could do such a richly textured and complicated life as Einstein's the same thoughtful justice. Isaacson is a master of the form and this latest opus is at once arresting and wonderfully revelatory. <i>--Anne Bartholomew</i><br><br> <b>Read "The Light-Beam Rider," the first chapter of Walter Isaacson's <i>Einstein: His Life and Universe</i>.</b> <b>Five Questions for Walter Isaacson</b> <br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> What kind of scientific education did you have to give yourself to be able to understand and explain Einstein's ideas?<br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> I've always loved science, and I had a group of great physicists--such as Brian Greene, Lawrence Krauss, and Murray Gell-Mann--who tutored me, helped me learn the physics, and checked various versions of my book. I also learned the tensor calculus underlying general relativity, but tried to avoid spending too much time on it in the book. I wanted to capture the imaginative beauty of Einstein's scientific leaps, but I hope folks who want to delve more deeply into the science will read Einstein books by such scientists as Abraham Pais, Jeremy Bernstein, Brian Greene, and others.<br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> That Einstein was a clerk in the Swiss Patent Office when he revolutionized our understanding of the physical world has often been treated as ironic or even absurd. But you argue that in many ways his time there fostered his discoveries. Could you explain? <br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> I think he was lucky to be at the patent office rather than serving as an acolyte in the academy trying to please senior professors and teach the conventional wisdom. As a patent examiner, he got to visualize the physical realities underlying scientific concepts. He had a boss who told him to question every premise and assumption. And as Peter Galison shows in <i>Einstein's Clocks, Poincare's Maps</i>, many of the patent applications involved synchronizing clocks using signals that traveled at the speed of light. So with his office-mate Michele Besso as a sounding board, he was primed to make the leap to special relativity.<br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> That time in the patent office makes him sound far more like a practical scientist and tinkerer than the usual image of the wild-haired professor, and more like your previous biographical subject, the multitalented but eminently earthly Benjamin Franklin. Did you see connections between them?<br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> I like writing about creativity, and that's what Franklin and Einstein shared. They also had great curiosity and imagination. But Franklin was a more practical man who was not very theoretical, and Einstein was the opposite in that regard. <br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> Of the many legends that have accumulated around Einstein, what did you find to be least true? Most true? <br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> The least true legend is that he failed math as a schoolboy. He was actually great in math, because he could visualize equations. He knew they were nature's brushstrokes for painting her wonders. For example, he could look at Maxwell's equations and marvel at what it would be like to ride alongside a light wave, and he could look at Max Planck's equations about radiation and realize that Planck's constant meant that light was a particle as well as a wave. The most true legend is how rebellious and defiant of authority he was. You see it in his politics, his personal life, and his science.<br><br> <b>Amazon.com:</b> At <i>Time</i> and CNN and the Aspen Institute, you've worked with many of the leading thinkers and leaders of the day. Now that you've had the chance to get to know Einstein so well, did he remind you of anyone from our day who shares at least some of his remarkable qualities? <br><br> <b>Isaacson:</b> There are many creative scientists, most notably Stephen Hawking, who wrote the essay on Einstein as "Person of the Century" when I was editor of <i>Time</i>. In the world of technology, Steve Jobs has the same creative imagination and ability to think differently that distinguished Einstein, and Bill Gates has the same intellectual intensity. I wish I knew politicians who had the creativity and human instincts of Einstein, or for that matter the wise feel for our common values of Benjamin Franklin. <br><br> <p><b>More to Explore</b> </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <p><br><i>Benjamin Franklin: An American Life</i> </p></td> <td><br><i>Kissinger: A Biography </i></td> <td><br><i>The Wise Men: Six Friends and the World They Made </i></td> </tr></tbody></table>Walter Isaacson, University Professor of History at Tulane, has been CEO of the Aspen Institute, chairman of CNN, and editor of&nbsp;<i>Time</i>&nbsp;magazine.

Nicholas Krushenick is a key figure in the history of late 20th-century American art. Juxtaposing broad black lines with bold, flat Liquitex colors, Krushenick created hard-edged abstractions that fill his canvases from corner to corner. His energetic forms used experiments in cut paper collage as a springboard, creating an aesthetic all his own that earned him the title &#x201c;father of Pop abstraction.&#x201d; This book offers a mix of archival writings and interviews with new perspectives on the artist who is largely considered a precursor to Pop Art. Preparatory drawings, early collages, and scenes of Krushenick in his studio offer insight into the artist&#x2019;s creative process, while newly commissioned essays take a fresh look at a remarkable oeuvre.</p><p>IAN BERRY is the Dayton Director of the Frances Young Tang Teaching Museum and Art Gallery at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY.<br><br>HARRY COOPER is curator and head of modern art at the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC.<br><br>BARRY SCHWABSKY is an author and art critic for <i>The Nation</i> and co-editor of international reviews for <i>Artforum</i>.</p><h2>2150 A.D.</h2><p>a mind challenging novel.

After wreaking havoc in the skies over Arras the Albatros was eventually outclassed by succeeding generations of Allied aircraft, but still remained the most numerous and ubiquitous of all German fighters in World War I, with Albatros biplanes contributing almost two-thirds of the German fighters at the front during the Spring Offensive of 1918.</p><p>This book, with its 32 color profiles, charts the unique markings and design of one of the most menacingly beautiful fighters of the war. Featuring famous and unsung aces, a multitude of first-hand accounts and original photographs, this book offers a fresh view into the experiences of the German pilots who endured a very different kind of war from the troops on the ground. While the soldiers confronted the dangers of No-Man's Land and faceless slaughter, the pilots endured deadly games of cat and mouse in the skies above the trenches.</p></p><p>Osprey&#39;s Aircraft of the Aces series combines full colour artwork, the best archival contemporary photography, and first hand accounts from aces to bring history&#39;s greatest airborne conflicts to life.Greg VanWyngarden has a lifelong interest in World War 1 aviation, and has been particularly active in deciphering the colors and markings that decorated the various German fighters flown by the leading aces.

Normally that wouldn&#x2019;t bother Toby Peters, since detective work tends to keep him far away from animal cages, but tonight he&#x2019;s dressed as a clown and locked in with the ape. The animal&#x2019;s handler told him not to worry - gorillas don&#x2019;t eat people. They just like to tear their arms and legs off. </p><p>What the ape doesn&#x2019;t understand is that Peters is here for his protection. Earlier that week, someone electrocuted an elephant, and the gorilla, as one of the star attractions in this second-rate circus, is next on the hit list. Someone is killing animals to kill the circus, and if that doesn&#x2019;t work they may move on to human prey. Toby Peters has a shot at unraveling this big top mystery, as long as he survives his night in the gorilla&#x2019;s cage.</p></p><p><p>Stuart M. Kaminsky (1934-2009) was one of the most prolific crime fiction authors of the last four decades. Born in Chicago, Kaminsky penned more than sixty novels over his lifetime. In 1981's Death of a Dissident, Kaminsky debuted Moscow police detective Porfiry Rostnikov, whose stories were praised for their accurate depiction of Soviet life. He died in St. Louis in 2009.</p>Toby Peters, the scruffy but suave private eye, becomes entangled in a series of mishaps and murders in a traveling circus. The smell of the greasepaint and roar of the crowd, not to mention to seedier side of circus life, are brought to life as Peters comes to the aid of the consummate clown, Emmett Kelly. Reader Tom Parker provides distinct vocal characterizations but resists exaggeration--an impressive feat given the menagerie of personalities ranging from dwarf actor to giant wrestler, and Jewish dentist to eastern European lion tamer. Even Alfred Hitchcock makes an appearance in a voice easily recognized. Parker's pace and articulation are perfect, allowing the listener to become immersed in the wacky story and glimpse the clown's thrill at making people laugh.

The planet most like ours, it has still been thought impossible to reach, let alone explore and inhabit. But all that changed when leading space exploration authority Robert Zubrin crafted a daring new blueprint, Mars Direct. When it was first published in 1996, <i>The Case for Mars </i>became an instant classic, lauded widely for its game-changing perspective by those who would see the American space program rise to the challenge of Mars; Carl Sagan called Zubrin the man who, &#x201c;nearly alone, changed our thinking on this issue.&#x201d; Now, fifteen years later, Zubrin brings readers up to date in this revised and updated anniversary edition filled with spectacular illustrations, extraordinary photographs, and one-of-a-kind anecdotes. <br><br>Unlike the dead world of the Moon, the Martian landscape is filled with possibility, but humans must be able to survive there. In the grand tradition of successful explorers, Zubrin calls for a travel-light and live-off-the-land approach to Martian settlement. He explains how scientists can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars; produce fuel and oxygen on the planet&#x2019;s surface with its own natural resources; build bases and settlements; and one day terraform&#x2014;or alter the atmosphere of the planet in order to pave the way for sustainable life. As the landmark mission of the Mars Science Laboratory begins, Zubrin lays out a comprehensive plan to build life on a new world.</p><p>&#34;For our generation and many that will follow, Mars is the New World,&#34; writes Zubrin. This book went to press serendipitously, just as NASA was making its startling if heavily-qualified announcement that simple life may have once existed on the fourth rock from the sun. Zubrin doesn&#39;t spend an enormous amount of time arguing why Mars exploration is desirable -- we all want astronauts to go there, don&#39;t we? -- but rather devotes the bulk of this book explaining how it can happen on a sensible, bare-bones budget of $20-30 billion and a &#34;travel light and live off the land&#34; philosophy.Since the beginning of human history Mars has been an alluring dream -- the stuff of legends, gods, and mystery. The planet most like ours, the planet where life may have once existed, but a planet thought to be impossible to reach and even more impossible to explore and inhabit. Now with the advent of a revolutionary new plan, all this has changed. <p>Leading space exploration authority Robert Zubrin has crafted a daring new blueprint, Mars Direct, that experts are hailing as the most visionary and pragmatic step toward expanding human activity in space since the Apollo Moon landings. Presented here with illustrations, photographs, and engaging anecdotes, Dr. Zubrin's plan will revive our hopes and dreams and convince us that other worlds can be reached -- affordably and within our lifetime. </p><p>Unlike the dead world of the Moon, the Martian landscape abounds with ancient canyons, dried river beds, the remains of frozen polar oceans, and enormous ice caps. The possibilities for exploration and discovery are nearly limitless; but significant exploration of Mars can only occur on her surface, and in order to do that we must be able to survive there. In the great tradition of human exploration, Dr. Zubrin's plan calls for a travel-light and live-off-the-land approach. He explains step-by-step how we can use present-day technology to send humans to Mars within ten years; actually produce fuel and oxygen on the planet's surface with Martian natural resources; how we can build bases and settlements; and how we can one day "terraform" Mars -- a process that can alter the atmosphere of planets and pave the way for sustainable life. </p><p>Under Dr. Zubrin's program, a human mission is only the first step toward a day when research bases and eventual colonies can be developed on Mars' surface. Mars possesses enormous chemical and mineral resources, all of which can be put to use in pursuit of travel, exploration, structures, and a variety of human activities on a planet that is neither as harsh nor as unreachable as we popularly believe. </p><p><i>The Case For Mars</i> is not a vision for the far future or one that will cost us impossible billions. It is a plan that can be put into action today if we are willing to rethink our traditional methods and costs. Zubrin maps out how the use of Martian resources, innovations, streamlined approaches, and a series of manageable government grants coupled with the efforts of private enterprise can make repeated humans-to-Mars missions possible. </p><p>Our nation was born in dreams of exploration, and so must it continue if we are to vault into our next chapter of history. Mars presents us with a new world of questions, hopes, and possibilities; and the stirring vision of <i>The Case For Mars</i> will take us directly to its threshold and beyond.</p></p><h2>Mononoke Sharing Vol. 3 (Mononoke Sharing, 3)</h2><p><p><b>EVICTED?!</b></p><p>They may be shameless, they may be dangerous, and they <i>definitely</i> inspire breast envy, but Yata&#x2019;s grown to love the oddball mononoke she shares a home with.

Original.</p><p><p><strong>Robyn Carr</strong> is a RITA� Award-winning, #1 <em>New York Times bestselling</em> author of more than forty novels, including the critically acclaimed Virgin River series. Robyn and her husband live in Las Vegas, Nevada. You can visit Robyn Carr&#x2019;s website at www.RobynCarr.com.</p>June Hudson had nerves of steel. She was thirty-seven years old, had been the town doctor in Grace Valley, California, for over ten years and the things she'd been called upon to do were not for the faint of heart. June had delivered a baby in the back of a pickup truck, kept a logger's severed limb on ice waiting for the emergency helicopter and had given calm, intelligent medical advice while looking down the barrel of a marijuana farmer's gun. Oh, she was feminine enough, but tough. Strong. Fearless.<p>Maybe not fearless, but she had certainly learned how to <i>appear </i>fearless. She had learned this in Omnipotent Physician 101.</p><p>Then came an early morning phone call bearing portentous news that caused her heart to race and her brow and upper lip to bead with sweat. All the strength bled out of her legs as she sank helplessly to the kitchen stool.</p><p>The conversation started out innocently enough with her friend Birdie reporting, "Chris is coming home with the boys." Chris was Birdie's son, the boys her twin fourteen-year-old grandsons.</p><p>"For a visit?" June half asked, half assumed.</p><p>"For good, he says. He and Nancy are divorcing."</p><p>June was silent. Shocked. Dismayed. <i>Divorcing? </i></p><p>"He asked if you were still single," Birdie went on, a lilt to her chipper voice. A hopeful little lilt.</p><p>That was when June the Fearless began to tremble and quake. Chris was an old boyfriend. In fact, her first love. Also her first and most terrible broken heart. Chris Forrest was the man June always vowed she would tie up and torture for the agony he had brought to her youth.</p><p>The only son of Birdie and Judge Forrest, Chris had lived in southern California for eighteen or so years, married to another high-school friend&#x2014;or rival&#x2014; Nancy Cruise. He had only returned to Grace Valley for visits a few times; his parents enjoyed their trips to his home in San Diego. During his rare appearances, June did her best to avoid him. When she did happen upon him, she was as cool as a cucumber, aloof and detached. Her posture and expression said that bygones were bygones, that she rarely even thought about him.</p><p>It was partly true. She didn't spend a great deal of time mooning over a twenty-year-old romance gone awry. On the other hand, whenever she saw him, she was instantly reminded of two things: right after high school he had dumped her for Nancy without explanation or apology, and his boyish good looks had not deserted him. She hated him on both counts.</p><p>And now, divorced, he wondered if she was available? Hah! In your dreams, Chris Forrest, she thought with the long-lasting venom of a lover scorned.</p><p>She made a little small talk with Birdie, who was quite naturally excited by this turn of events. After hanging up the phone June remained on the kitchen stool, dazed, her thoughts concentrated mainly on planning Chris's slow death. Then the phone rang again.</p><p>"Chris Forrest is moving back to Grace Valley," her father, Elmer, reported.</p><p>"Really?" she faked. "Birdie and Judge must be delighted."</p><p>"Seems he split with Nancy and has custody of his kids, which I suppose makes sense, them being boys and all."</p><p>"How nice."</p><p>"Divorced," Elmer clarified.</p><p>"I didn't mean that part was nice," June said. "Him coming back here with sons. That's nice. Especially for Birdie and Judge."</p><p>"Does that put a little flush in your cheeks?" Elmer wanted to know. "Him being single again?"</p><p>She felt her cheeks, which were aflame, but not with the heat of passion. Could her father actually imagine she'd welcome the lout back into her arms? "Certainly not. That was a childhood thing. I've been over that for a couple of decades now."</p><p>"That so?" Elmer wanted to know. "Meat loaf tonight at your place?"</p><p>"Dad? Did you happen to hear when they're coming back?"</p><p>"I believe Judge said right away, as Chris wants to get his boys signed up for school. So...meat loaf? It's Tuesday again already."</p><p>"Right away?" She absently touched her hair, still damp from the shower. She'd never been good at things like hair. She could get an inflamed appendix out in no time and leave a scar that would be the envy of a plastic surgeon, but her dark blond, shoulder-length hair&#x2014;or dishwater blond, as her mother used to call it&#x2014;was beyond her understanding.</p><p>Nancy had always had great hair: thick, richly brown, long, shiny.</p><p>June looked at her hands. Doctor's hands. Short nails, pink knuckles from scrubbing them dozens of times a day, and...what was that? An <i>age </i>spot?</p><p>She had heard that Chris, Nancy and their boys belonged to a country club.</p><p>"I'll see you here at about six, Dad."</p><p>"You okay, June? You sound awfully tired. You go out on calls last night?"</p><p>She heard a familiar alarm from her bedroom when her pager, set to vibrate, began dancing around on top of the bedside stand. Grrrr. With the cordless phone at her ear, she dashed to get it. "No, I wasn't called out at all. It was a quiet night. Oops, gotta go, Dad. I've got a page. See you later?"</p><p>"Later," he agreed.</p><p>The pager revealed the number for the police department, with a 911 attached to indicate an emergency. Chris Forrest disappeared as June went into a different mind-set and dialed. "June here," she said.</p><p>Deputy Ricky Rios had paged her. "Chief Toopeek responded to a call about a shooting at the Culley stables, June. Said he needs you out there as soon as possible."</p><p>"Is Tom calling for the paramedics or a helicopter?" she asked while slipping on her shoes.</p><p>"He just asked for you," Ricky said.</p><p>June grabbed her bag and a clip for her damp hair, whistled for her collie, Sadie, and was out the door in under fifteen seconds. She was on call, a service she shared with John Stone, the other Grace Valley physician, and therefore drove the town's new ambulance. It was so new that it still intimidated her, and though she turned on the lights and siren, she didn't drive any faster than usual. It was early morning; she didn't want to hit an animal or round a curve in the road and slam into slow-moving farm equipment.</p><p>Even though June now had a radio at her disposal, she didn't use it to contact Tom Toopeek to ask about the shooting, because many of the citizens in Grace Valley also had radios. It was like a big party line. Of course, with the way everyone minded everyone else's business in the town, she might as well get on the radio and give them a heads up. They'd have all the details by lunchtime anyway.</p><p>Daniel and Blythe Culley lived in a medium-size, ordinary ranch house on acreage large enough to support two stables that were by no means ordinary, five corrals, and still provide plentiful grazing land at the foothills of the Coast Ranges mountains. Horse people from Kentucky, they had started out small but a decade or so back they'd had great success with a stallion racing in San Francisco and San Diego, and the reputation of the stable had soared. Boarders, breeders, trainers and sometimes racers, they employed as many as twenty hands, depending on how many horses they had in residence. Clients came from everywhere and the Culleys were kept busy year-round.</p><p>June didn't speculate much on what might have happened. Nearly everyone in the valley had guns, especially if they lived in the country and had to contend with wildlife. One of the hands might have had a mishap or, less likely, a disagreement that led to a showdown. Rushing to the stables, she thought abstractedly about the Culleys and the kind of people they were&#x2014;salt of the earth. It came to mind how happy and devoted a couple they had always been. Quiet, but friendly and helpful. They kept to themselves, since building up a stable of some repute required backbreaking commitment. Farmers, ranchers, vintners, loggers and the like worked from dawn to dusk, slept hard and worked more. A strong partnership, a strong marriage, like what the Culleys had, was required. June thought it such a pity that they hadn't had children to raise on their land. They'd have made admirable parents.</p><p>Although it was now 7:00 a.m., the tall trees caused the sun to slant weakly into the yard and an eerie cloud of fog lingered in front of the house. Tom's Range Rover was parked about a hundred yards from the house and he stood beside it, his rifle balanced in a nonthreatening way upon his right shoulder. A barrel had been tipped onto its side and Daniel lay over it, his pants pulled unceremoniously down to his thighs, his buttocks, freckled with buckshot, catching the cool morning breeze.</p><p>"Daniel, what the heck...?" she began, getting out of the ambulance with her bag in hand.</p><p>"That old woman's lost her mind," he said.</p><p>"<i>Blythe </i>did this to you?"</p><p>"You know any other crazy old woman out here?" he wanted to know.</p><p>"Well, I&#x2014;" First of all, she thought, they're not old. Blythe was around fifty-five, Daniel maybe a little bit older. It was hard to tell. They were a young couple when they'd moved to Grace Valley, and June hadn't had occasion to treat either one of them. That in itself had never been curious to her until that moment. Why would they travel to another town for their medical needs? Had they not trusted her father, Elmer, the town doctor before her? They were quite friendly with Elmer. Perhaps, unlike most of the townsfolk, they didn't <i>want </i>a doctor with whom they were well acquainted.</p><p>"Where is Blythe?" she finally asked.</p><p>Tom, not uttering a word, tipped his rifle slightly in the direction of the house. There, through the morning mist, June could see Blythe sitting in a rocking chair on the porch, the gun lying comfortably across her lap.</p><p>"Have you talked to her?" she asked Tom.</p><p>"Just from a safe distance. It appears she needs a little time to think about things."</p><p>"You let that woman think much longer," Daniel said, "she's likely to stomp down here and put the muzzle to my head, which I should have had examined about thirty years ago for getting into this bargain."</p><p>June looked at his pocked, inflamed backside. "I'm going to have to take you to the clinic, Daniel. We'll need some antiseptic and bandages...and nice, fine tweezers. But you'll be all right." She coughed lightly and behind her hand she...</p></p><h2>The Last Holiday: A Memoir</h2><p>The stunning memoir of Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award winner Gil Scott-Heron, <i>The Last Holiday</i> has been praised for bringing back to life one of the most important voices of the last fifty years.

Scott-Heron refined an intoxicating hybrid of jazz, Latin, and Afro idioms that established him in the vanguard of black American music in the 1970s.&#x201d; <i>The Telegraph</i> (UK)<br>A jazz and blues poet-musician known as a spoken-word performer, Scott-Heron is often called the godfather of rap and is indeed considered one of the founding fathers of hip-hop. Among his most influential works is the composition The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, which originally appeared on his album Small Talk at 125th and Lenox (1970). This well-written and fresh memoir, posthumously published&#x2014;he died in May 2011&#x2014;recalls Scott-Heron&#x2019;s upbringing in Jackson, Tennessee, and New York City. He was the son of an opera singer and a Jamaican soccer player (the first black athlete to play for the Glasgow Celtic football team in Scotland) and was among the few black students to attend the prestigious Fieldston School in New York. Scott-Heron comments on his love of language and his respect for education. He discusses his recording career, including the critically acclaimed Winter in America (1974); his publishing career; and his 1980 tour with Stevie Wonder. Engrossing and even at times uplifting, Scott-Heron&#x2019;s self-portrait grants us insights into one of the most influential African American musicians of his generation. --June Sawyers</p><h2>Gotham Central: The Quick and the Dead</h2><p>Living in the shadow of the Dark Knight makes the detectives of Gotham&#39;s police force determined to prove they have what it takes to enforce the law in a city rife with criminals--with or without Batman&#39;s help.</p><p>Ed Brubaker is responsible for revitalising the Catwoman comics and has also worked on Batman and Deadenders. Greg Rucka is currently one of the hottest writers around having worked on the whole range of Batman titles, Wolverine and Queen &amp; Country. Michael Lark has worked on prestigious titles including The Invisibles, JSA and The Sandman.It's telling that the best of the many comics featuring Batman and his crime-fighting associates is one in which the Caped Crusader appears only fleetingly. <i>Gotham Central</i> focuses on the city's police force, who contend with superpowered foes as well as mundane criminals. In the issues collected here, Batman becomes even more marginalized, since the Bat-Signal is removed from police headquarters after a falling-out between the department and the costumed vigilante. Plot and character, rather than superhero action, drive crime-novelist Rucka's compelling story lines, and although original artist Michael Lark departs halfway through this run, successor Stefano Gaudiano admirably maintains Lark's low-key, muted approach. <i>Gordon Flagg</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In Come Unto Me, volume 2 of the bestselling series The Kingdom and the Crown, Simeon of Capernaum wrestles with how to undo the damage wrought by his reluctant conversion to a man called Jesus of Nazareth. His determination to follow the teachings of the Master has cost the life of one friend and sent three others to a Roman prison to await execution. How can he stay true to the teachings of Jesus, which require that he love his enemies, and yet deliver the friends who face death because of him? A similar dilemma faces Miriam of Jerusalem. Her father, along with the other leaders of the powerful Sanhedrin, are determined to stamp out the growing popularity of this itinerant preacher from Nazareth. But Miriam too has found Jesus to be far more than a mere man, and this poses a terrible choice for her - will she follow family or faith? From the Galilee to Jerusalem to the great city of Rome, Come Unto Me continues the story of the people whose lives are forever changed by the teachings of a simple carpenter from Nazareth.

It gave me a thrill writing the age I&#x2019;d be on my next birthday because everyone knew that once you hit double digits, you weren&#x2019;t a child anymore. The green chalk, borrowed from the scoreboard of my father&#x2019;s dartboard without his knowledge, was so stubby that my fingers scraped against the concrete of the driveway as I put the final touches to my creation.</p><p>&#x201c;There, it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d; I stood back and studied my handiwork. As usual, I was disappointed that something I&#x2019;d made hadn&#x2019;t turned out quite as good as I&#x2019;d imagined. </p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect,&#x201d; Cat declared, reading my mind as she always did, and trying to reassure me before I washed the grid off in a fit of self doubt.&nbsp; I smiled even though her opinion shouldn&#x2019;t have counted for much; my identical twin sister was easily impressed by everything I did. &#x201c;You go first,&#x201d; Cat said. </p><p>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; </p><p>I pulled the bronze half-cent coin from my pocket, and rubbed it for luck before launching it into the air from my thumbnail. It arced and spun, glinting in the sunlight, and when it finally landed in the first square, I launched myself forward, eager to finish the grid in record time. </p><p>I finished three circuits before the coin skittered out of the square marked &#x2018;4&#x2019;. It should have ended my turn, but I shot a quick look at Cat who was distracted by a hadeda bird making a racket on the neighbour&#x2019;s roof. Before she could notice my mistake, I nudged the coin back in place with the tip of my canvas shoe and carried on jumping.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re doing so well,&#x201d; Cat called a few seconds later once she&#x2019;d turned back and noticed my progress. </p><p>Spurred on by her clapping and encouragement, I hopped even faster, not noticing until it was too late that a lace on one of my <i>takkies </i>had come loose. It tripped me up just as I cleared the last square and brought me crashing down knee-first, my skin scraped raw on the rough concrete. I cried out, first in alarm and then in pain, and it was this noise that brought my mother&#x2019;s flip-flops clacking into my line of vision. Her shadow fell over me.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh for goodness sake, not again.&#x201d; My mother reached down and yanked me up. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so clumsy. I don&#x2019;t know where you get it from.&#x201d; She tsked as I raised my bleeding knee so she could see. </p><p>Cat was crouched next to me, wincing at the sight of the gravel imbedded in the wound. Tears started to prickle, but I knew I had to stop their relentless progression quickly or suffer my mother&#x2019;s displeasure.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m fine. It&#x2019;s fine.&#x201d; I forced a watery smile and gingerly stood up.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, Robin,&#x201d; my mother sighed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to cry, are you? You know how ugly you are when you cry.&#x201d; She crossed her eyes and screwed up her face comically to illustrate her point and I forced the giggle she was looking for.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going to cry,&#x201d; I said.&nbsp; Crying in the driveway in plain sight of the neighbours would be an unforgiveable offense; my mother was very concerned with what other people thought and expected me to be as well. </p><p>&#x201c;Good girl.&#x201d; She smiled and kissed me on the top of my head as a reward for my bravery.</p><p>There was no time to savour the praise. The trill of the ringing phone cut through the morning and just like that, one of the last tender moments my mother and I would ever share was over. She blinked and the warmth in her eyes turned to exasperation. </p><p>&#x201c;Get Mabel to help clean you up, okay?&#x201d; </p><p>She&#x2019;d just disappeared through the back door into the kitchen when I became aware of whimpering and looked down to see that Cat was crying. Looking at my sister was always like looking into a mirror, but in that instant, it felt as though the glass between my reflection and me had been removed so that I wasn&#x2019;t looking at an image of myself; I was looking at myself. </p><p>The misery etched onto Cat&#x2019;s scrunched-up features was my misery. Her blue eyes welled with my tears and her pouty bottom lip trembled. Anyone who&#x2019;d ever doubted the veracity of twin empathy only had to see my sister suffering on my behalf to become a true believer.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Stop crying,&#x201d; I hissed. &#x201c;Do you want Mom calling you a cry baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But it looks like it hurts.&#x201d; </p><p>If only it were that straightforward in the eyes of our mother. &#x201c;Go to our room so she won&#x2019;t see you,&#x201d; I said, &#x201c;and only come out when you feel better.&#x201d; I tucked a strand of brown hair behind her ear.</p><p>&nbsp;She sniffed and nodded, and then scurried inside with her head bent. I followed a minute later and found our maid, Mabel, in the kitchen washing up the breakfast dishes. She was wearing her faded mint-green uniform (a coverall dress that was too tight on her plump frame, the buttons gaping apart where they fastened in the front) with a white apron and <i>doek</i>.</p><p>My mother was on the phone in the dining room using the carefree, happy voice she only ever used with one person: her sister, Edith. I left her to it, knowing that if I asked to speak to my aunt, I&#x2019;d be told either to stop interrupting grown-ups&#x2019; conversations, or to stop being so in love with the sound of my own voice. </p><p>&#x201c;Mabel, look.&#x201d; I said as I lifted up my knee, relieved that it wasn&#x2019;t one of her few Sundays off.</p><p>She cringed when she saw the blood, and her hands flew up to her mouth, sending suds flying.&nbsp; &#x201c;<i>Yoh</i>! <i>Yoh</i>! <i>Yoh</i>! I&#x2019;m sorry! I&#x2019;m sorry!&#x201d; she exclaimed as though she&#x2019;d personally caused my suffering. </p><p>To me, this litany was better than all the plasters in the world and an immediate balm to my pain.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x201c;Sit. I must see.&#x201d; She knelt down and inspected the scrape, wincing as she did so. &#x201c;I will fetch the first aid things.&#x201d; She pronounced it &#x2018;<i>festaid</i>&#x2019; in her strong accent and I savoured the word as I savoured all Mabel-English. I loved how she made regular English words sound like a totally different language, and I wondered if her children (whom I&#x2019;d never met and who lived in Qua-Qua all year round) spoke the same way. </p><p>She fetched the kit out from the scullery cupboard and knelt down again to tend to the graze, the cotton ball looking especially white against her brown skin. She soaked it with orange disinfectant and then held it to the wound, murmuring words of comfort each time I tried to pull away from the sting of it.&nbsp; </p><p>&#x201c;I am sorry! <i>Yoh</i>, I&#x2019;m sorry, see? I am almost finished. Almost, almost. You are a brave girl.&#x201d; <i>You arra brev gell</i>.</p><p>I basked in her focused attention and watched as she blew on my knee, amazed at how the tickle of her breath magically eased the pain. Once Mabel was satisfied that the broken skin was clean enough, she stuck a huge plaster over it and pinched my cheek. </p><p>&#x201c;Mwah, mwah, mwah.&#x201d; She placed lip-smacking kisses all over my face, and I held my breath waiting to see if this would be the day I finally got a kiss on the mouth. Her lips came as close as my chin before returning to my forehead. &#x201c;All better now!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you!&#x201d; I gave her a quick hug before heading out again, and I&#x2019;d just stepped out the back door when my father called me.</p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Freckles!&#x201d; He was sitting in a deck chair next to the portable <i>braai</i> he&#x2019;d set up in the bright patch of sunlight in the middle of the brown lawn. &#x201c;Get your old man a beer.&#x201d;</p><p>I ducked inside again and opened the fridge, pulling out a bottle of Castle Lager. My inexpert handling of the bottle opener resulted in a spray of foam across the linoleum floor but I didn&#x2019;t stop to wipe it up. Mabel clucked as I made a run for it, but I knew she&#x2019;d clean it without complaint.</p><p>&#x201c;Here you go,&#x201d; I said handing the still-foaming bottle to my father who immediately used it to douse the flames that had leapt up beyond the barrier of the grill.</p><p>&#x201c;Just in time,&#x201d; he said, nodding for me to sit in the chair next to him. </p><p>My father&#x2019;s blue eyes twinkled out at me from a handsome face that was mostly hidden behind a thicket of hair. Wavy blonde curls flopped over his eyebrows in the front, and grew long at the back so that they dipped over his shirt collar. He&#x2019;d also cultivated long mutton chop sideburns that just fell short of meeting up with his bushy moustache. Kissing him was always a ticklish undertaking, and I loved the bristly texture of his face against my skin. </p><p>I sat down and he handed me the<i> braai</i> tongs as if he was passing me a sacred object. He nodded in a solemn way and I nodded back to show I acknowledged the transference of power.&nbsp; I was now in charge of the meat. </p><p>My father smiled as I leaned into the smoke rising from the grill, and then he glanced at the plaster on my knee. &#x201c;You been through the wars again, Freckles?&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded and he laughed. My father often joked about having a son in a daughter&#x2019;s body. He especially loved to tell the story of how I&#x2019;d come home from my first and only ballet lesson when I was five years old with ripped tights and my leg covered in blood. When he&#x2019;d asked me how in the world I&#x2019;d managed to get so roughed up in a dancing class, I confessed that I&#x2019;d injured myself falling out of the tree I&#x2019;d climbed in order to hide away from the teacher. He&#x2019;d roared with laughter, and my mother had lectured me about wasting their money.</p><p>Teaching me how to <i>braai </i>was something my father should&#x2019;ve taught a son. If he felt cheated that he never got one, he never said so, and he encouraged my tomboyish behaviour at every opportunity.</p><p>Cat, on the other hand, was a sensitive child and in many ways, my complete opposite. She was also squeamish about raw meat. There was no way my father would ever have taught her the subtleties of cooking meat to perfection, or how to hold your fist when throwing a knockout punch, or how to bring someone down with a rugby tackle.</p><p>&#x201c;Okay, now turn the <i>wors</i>. Make sure you get the tongs under all the coils and flip them together or it&#x2019;s going to be a big mess. Good. Now, nudge the chops to the side or they&#x2019;re going to be overdone. You want to crisp the fat but not burn it.&#x201d;</p><p>I followed his instructions carefully and managed to cook the meat to his satisfaction. Once we were done, I carried the meat in a pan to the table Mabel had set for us on the flagstone patio. The garlic bread, potato salad and <i>mielies</i> were all already there, protected under a fly net that I sometimes used as a veil when I played at being a spy disguised as a bride.</p><p>&#x201c;Tell your mother we&#x2019;re ready,&#x201d; my father said as he sat down. He didn&#x2019;t trust the giant hadedas with their long beaks not to swoop down and steal the meat; they often swiped dog food left outside in bowls, and had been known to go for bigger prey like fish in ornamental ponds.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s on the phone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Well, tell her to get off. I&#x2019;m hungry.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re ready to eat,&#x201d; I yelled around the doorway before stepping back outside again.</p><p>I&#x2019;d just sat down next to my father when Cat trailed outside to join us. She&#x2019;d washed all evidence of tears from her face, and smiled as our mother sat down next to her.</p><p>&#x201c;Who was that on the phone?&#x201d; My father asked, reaching for the butter and Bovril spread to slather over his <i>mielie</i>.</p><p>&#x201c;Edith.&#x201d;</p><p>My father rolled his eyes. &#x201c;What does she want?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nothing. She&#x2019;s got some vicious stomach bug that&#x2019;s going around and she&#x2019;s been grounded until it clears.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose that&#x2019;s a huge crisis in her life? Not being able to serve shitty airplane food on overpriced flights to hoity toity passengers. God, your sister can make a mountain out of a molehill.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not a crisis, Keith. Who said it was a crisis? She just wanted to talk.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Wanted to suck you into the drama of her life, more like it.&#x201d;</p><p>My mother raised her voice. &#x201c;What drama?&#x201d; </p><p>Cat&#x2019;s eyes were wide as they darted between our parents. She pulled her gaze away from them and stared at me. Her meaning was clear. <i>Do something! </i></p><p>&#x201c;Everything&#x2019;s a drama with her,&#x201d; my father said, matching my mother&#x2019;s increased volume. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s never just a small hiccup; it&#x2019;s always the end of the world.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not the end of the world! Who said it&#x2019;s the end of the world?&#x201d; My mother thwacked the serving spoon back into the salad bowl. She glowered at him and the vein in her forehead began to bulge, never a good sign. &#x201c;God! Why must you always give her a hard time? She just wanted to -&#x201d;</p><p>The doorbell rang. </p><p>Cat&#x2019;s expression of relief said it all. <i>Saved by the bell!</i></p><p>&nbsp;&#x201c;Oh, for God&#x2019;s sake!&#x201d; My father threw down his cutlery so that it clattered across the table. &#x201c;Look at the time. Who has no bloody manners rocking up at lunchtime on a Sunday?&#x201d; My mother stood to go but my father held her back. &#x201c;Let Mabel get it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I told her to take the afternoon off and said she could come in tonight to do the dishes.&#x201d;</p><p>As my mother disappeared into the house, my father called after her. &#x201c;If it&#x2019;s the Jehovah&#x2019;s Witnesses, tell them to piss off or I&#x2019;ll shoot them. Tell them I have a big gun and I&#x2019;m not afraid to use it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wonder who it is.&#x201d; Cat asked and I shrugged.

I borrowed them to her.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lent them,&#x201d; my mother corrected.</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, lent them.&#x201d;</p><p>My father reached across the table to pick up the books. &#x201c;&#x2018;The Magic Faraway Tree&#x2019; and &#x2018;The Famous Five&#x2019;,&#x201d; he read. &#x201c;Books by Enid Blyton?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, apparently Gertruida took exception to the character&#x2019;s names and told me, in no uncertain terms, that Robin is a bad influence and she doesn&#x2019;t want her playing with Elsabe anymore.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What names? What is the bloody woman talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>My mother paused before answering. &#x201c;Dick and Fanny.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Are you being serious?&#x201d;</p><p>My mother nodded. &#x201c;Yes, she said they&#x2019;re disgusting names that shouldn&#x2019;t be allowed in a Christian household.&#x201d;</p><p>My father guffawed and that set my mother off. They were both in fits of giggles and it was my turn to look to Cat in mystification. I didn&#x2019;t know what was so funny. </p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t meant to upset Elsabe or Mrs Bekker; all I&#x2019;d tried to do was start my own secret society like the children in the books.

Lee, Miller, and dedicated fans refused to believe it could, and after 10 years, the Liaden Universe has returned from book limbo! If you can find them, look for other books in the series: <i>Partners in Necessity</i>, an omnibus of the first three novels, another omnibus containing two prequels, and the fifth book, <i>I Dare</i>. But feel free to start here: <i>Plan B</i> stands alone, though previous books provide rich back-story.<p> Meet Val Con yos'Phelium of Clan Korval. Val Con was once an "agent of change": recruited by Liad's Department of Interior (DOI) and redesigned--his memories blocked, his emotions suppressed--into a precision killing device. Val Con's sanity was saved by his lifemate, Miri Robertson. She's a half-Terran former mercenary sergeant even shorter than Val Con, and almost as deadly in combat. Miri also has Liaden dramliza (wizard) blood from her mother's family, Clan Erob. In Liaden society, one's melant'i (roughly: reputation, or face) is preserved by appropriate speech and behavior, including honor duels when a Balance is owed. Miri is nervous but Val Con says: "'<i>Together</i>, cha'trez, we are--' he bent his head, put his mouth next to her ear and breathed '--<i>hell on wheels</i>.'"</p><p> DOI has plotted to destroy Korval; Korval now invokes Plan B: retreat strategically, trust no one, prepare for all-out war. Val Con and Miri are trapped by an invasion force of the militaristic Yxtrang as they await Val Con's foster siblings, who are arming the clan. And of course their adopted Clutch brothers, Edger and Sheather, who resemble giant turtles, are also on their way. Somewhat more slowly.

When Bama Faustina approached publishing houses in Tamil Nadu with the story of how she was discriminated against in the Catholic Church, they refused to publish her unpolished words. Undeterred, she took her story to the public on her own, and wove a tale of history, caste oppression and sociology to tell how women of so-called low castes are discriminated against in Convents even today. Shocking, since Caste is not a part of Christianity. The book draws readers into Bama's world, and rest assured, it is a world telling the poignant tale of a woman who has prevailed through sheer perseverence in the face of oppression and troubles throughout. Readers will enjoy the updated afterword, which reveals Bama's thoughts on her life ten years after the first publication of the book.</p><p>Bama is the most celebrated contemporary Dalit woman writer.

It's July 1969, and Chris spends his days piloting his cardboard-box rocket, battling extraterrestrials, and voyaging to distant planets. But at night, fear of the dark has him seeing terrifying shadow aliens everywhere and seeking safety in his parents' bed. Everything changes when he watches the Apollo 11 moon landing on television and catches an awestruck glimpse of outer space, "the darkest dark ever." Later, unsettling shadows still occupy his unlit room, but Chris is different: with eyes newly opened to "the power and mystery and velvety black beauty of the dark," he can't wait to explore the night sky&#x2014;a dream that will always keep him company (and ultimately come true). Rendered in graphite and digitally colored in dusky hues, the luminous illustrations provide realistic portrayals of the action along with emotionally evocative depictions of the fantastical elements, from the just-menacing-enough coal black silhouettes of nighttime creatures to a wonder-filled dreamscape showing the pajama-clad space-helmeted boy (and his loyal pug companion) floating above his bed surrounded by stars and planets, rocket ships, and animals.

His prolific career spans over one hundred books, including four bestselling series and dozens of short stories and articles. He has won multiple Edgar and Shamus awards, two Falcon Awards from the Maltese Falcon Society of Japan, the Nero and Philip Marlowe Awards, the Cartier Diamond Dagger from the Crime Writers Association of America, and many others. Aside from being a mystery writer, he has also written a number of episodes for television, including two episodes of the ESPN series&nbsp;<i>Tilt</i>; he also cowrote the screenplay for the film&nbsp;<i>My Blueberry Nights</i>, starring Norah Jones. Block currently lives in New York City with his wife, Lynne.This is as near perfect as a private-eye thriller can get. Block is the utter professional, a master who holds the reader in the palm of his hand for as long as the pages need to be turned. His hero is former cop Matthew Scudder, now coasting as a part-time investigator and faithfully attending AA meetings on the side. A former flame, a savvy call girl, tells him that a psycho who came into her life many years ago (and whom Scudder helped send to jail) is out and seeking revenge on both of them. A friend, a call girl gone straight, is killed along with her whole family in Ohio, and Scudder gets on the case, fighting for his own life and, as the killer's murderous capabilities become apparent, for the lives of everyone he knows. The New York settings are superbly authentic, the dialogue is hip, sometimes touching but never mawkish, and the resolution--after Scudder's old cop buddies decline involvement in what looks too much like a personal vendetta--is hair-raising. Almost anyone writing suspense fiction could learn a great deal from Block; and those in search of sophisticated thrills need look no further.

The historic collaboration between Frederik Pohl and his fellow founding father of the genre, Arthur C. Clarke, is both a momentous literary event and a fittingly grand farewell from the late, great visionary author of 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br><br>The Last Theorem<i> </i>is a story of one man&#x2019;s mathematical obsession, and a celebration of the human spirit and the scientific method. It is also a gripping intellectual thriller in which humanity, facing extermination from all-but-omnipotent aliens, the Grand Galactics, must overcome differences of politics and religion and come together . . . or perish. <br><br>In 1637, the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat scrawled a note in the margin of a book about an enigmatic theorem: &#x201c;I have discovered a truly marvelous proof of this proposition which this margin is too narrow to contain.&#x201d; He also neglected to record his proof elsewhere. Thus began a search for the Holy Grail of mathematics&#x2013;a search that didn&#x2019;t end until 1994, when Andrew Wiles published a 150-page proof. But the proof was burdensome, overlong, and utilized mathematical techniques undreamed of in Fermat&#x2019;s time, and so it left many critics unsatisfied&#x2013;including young Ranjit Subramanian, a Sri Lankan with a special gift for mathematics and a passion for the famous &#x201c;Last Theorem.&#x201d;<br><br>When Ranjit writes a three-page proof of the theorem that relies exclusively on knowledge available to Fermat, his achievement is hailed as a work of genius, bringing him fame and fortune. But it also brings him to the attention of the National Security Agency and a shadowy United Nations outfit called Pax per Fidem, or Peace Through Transparency, whose secretive workings belie its name. Suddenly Ranjit&#x2013;together with his wife, Myra de Soyza, an expert in artificial intelligence, and their burgeoning family&#x2013;finds himself swept up in world-shaking events, his genius for abstract mathematical thought put to uses that are both concrete and potentially deadly. <br><br>Meanwhile, unbeknownst to anyone on Earth, an alien fleet is approaching the planet at a significant percentage of the speed of light. Their mission: to exterminate the dangerous species of primates known as homo sapiens.</p><p>Arthur C. Clarke has long been considered the greatest science fiction writer of all time. He was an international treasure in many other ways, including the fact that a 1945 article by him led to the invention of satellite technology. Books by Clarke&#x2013;both fiction and nonfiction&#x2013;have sold more than one hundred million copies worldwide. He died in 2008.<b><br><br></b>Frederik Pohl is the author of many novels, including The Boy Who Would Live Forever; Gateway, part of his acclaimed Heechee saga; and Jem, for which he won the National Book Award. With Isaac Asimov, he was a founding member of the New York-based science fiction group known as the Futurians. In the sixties, Pohl edited Galaxy magazine and its sister magazine, if, which won the Hugo Award three years in a row. In 1993, he became a Science Fiction Writers of America Grand Master. He lives in Palatine, Illinois.<b><br></b><i>Chapter One<br>ON SWAMI ROCK</i><br><br>And so now, at last, we meet this Ranjit Subramanian, the one whose long&nbsp;and remarkable life this book is all about.&nbsp;<br><br>At this time Ranjit was sixteen years old, a freshman at Sri Lanka&#x2019;s&nbsp;principal university, in the city of Colombo, and more full of himself than&nbsp;even your average sixteen- year- old. He wasn&#x2019;t at the university now,&nbsp;though. At his father&#x2019;s bidding he had made the long trip from Colombo&nbsp;slantwise across the island of Sri Lanka to the district of Trincomalee,&nbsp;where his father had the distinction of being chief priest at the Hindu temple&nbsp;called Tiru Koneswaram. Ranjit actually loved his father very much.&nbsp;<br><br>He was almost always glad to see him. This time, however, he was a bit less&nbsp;so, because this time Ranjit had a pretty good idea of what the revered&nbsp;Ganesh Subramanian wanted to talk to him about.&nbsp;<br><br>Ranjit was an intelligent boy, in fact one who was quite close to being&nbsp;as smart as he thought he was. He was a good- looking one, too. He wasn&#x2019;t&nbsp;terribly tall, but most Sri Lankans aren&#x2019;t. Ethnically he was a Tamil, and&nbsp;his skin color was the rich dark brown of a spoonful of cocoa powder, just&nbsp;before it went into the hot milk. The skin color wasn&#x2019;t because he was a&nbsp;Tamil, though. Sri Lankans have a rich palette of complexions from near-&nbsp;Scandinavian white to a black so dark it seems almost purple. Ranjit&#x2019;s best&nbsp;friend, Gamini Bandara, was pure Sinhalese for as many generations back&nbsp;as anyone had bothered to count, but the boys were the same in skin hue.&nbsp;The boys had been friends for a long time&#x2014;since that scary night&nbsp;when Gamini&#x2019;s school had burned to the ground, probably put to the torch&nbsp;by a couple of upperclassmen smoking forbidden cigarettes in a storage&nbsp;room.&nbsp;<br><br>Like every other nearby human being capable of picking up a splintered&nbsp;piece of plywood and throwing it on the back of a truck, Ranjit had&nbsp;been drafted for emergency relief work. So had all the rest of the student&nbsp;body of his own school. It had been a dirty job, a lot harder than a youngster&#x2019;s developing muscles were used to, not to mention the splinters and the&nbsp;scrapes and the endless cuts from the broken glass that was everywhere.&nbsp;Those were the bad parts, and there were plenty of them. But there&nbsp;were good parts, too. Like the time when Ranjit and some other boy&nbsp;around his own age finally got down to the source of some plaintive sounds&nbsp;that were coming from a debris pile, and released the headmaster&#x2019;s terrified,&nbsp;but intact, elderly Siamese cat.&nbsp;<br><br>When a teacher had carried the cat off to its owner, the two boys had&nbsp;stood grinning at each other. Ranjit had stuck his hand out, English fashion.&nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Ranjit Subramanian,&#x201d; he&#x2019;d said.&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m Gamini Bandara,&#x201d; the other boy had said, pumping his hand&nbsp;gleefully, &#x201c;and, hey, we did a pretty good job here, didn&#x2019;t we?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br><br>They agreed that they had. When at last they had been allowed to quit&nbsp;work for the day, they had lined up together for the sort of porridge that&nbsp;was their evening meal, and plopped their sleeping bags next to each other&nbsp;that night, and they had been best friends ever since. Helped out, to be&nbsp;sure, by the fact that Gamini&#x2019;s school had been made uninhabitable by the&nbsp;fire and so its students had to double up at Ranjit&#x2019;s. Gamini turned out to&nbsp;be pretty much everything a best friend could be, including the fact that the&nbsp;one great obsession in Ranjit&#x2019;s life, the one for which there was no room&nbsp;for another person to share, didn&#x2019;t interest Gamini at all.&nbsp;<br><br>And, of course, there was one other thing that Gamini was. That was&nbsp;the part of Ranjit&#x2019;s impending talk with his father that Ranjit least wanted&nbsp;to have.&nbsp;<br><br>Ranjit grimaced to himself. As instructed, Ranjit went straight to one&nbsp;of the temple&#x2019;s side doors, but it wasn&#x2019;t his father who met him there. It&nbsp;was an elderly monk named Surash who told Ranjit&#x2014;rather officiously,&nbsp;Ranjit thought&#x2014;only that he would have to wait a bit. So Ranjit waited, for&nbsp;what he considered quite a long time, with nothing to do but listen to the&nbsp;bustle that came from within his father&#x2019;s temple, about which Ranjit had&nbsp;mixed emotions.&nbsp;<br><br>The temple had given his father purpose, position, and a rewarding career,&nbsp;all of which was good. However, it had also encouraged the old man&nbsp;in the vain hope that his son would follow in his footsteps. That was not&nbsp;going to happen. Even as a boy, Ranjit had not been able to believe in the&nbsp;complex Hindu pantheon of gods and goddesses, some with their various&nbsp;animal heads and unusual number of arms, whose sculptured figures encrusted&nbsp;the temple walls. Ranjit had been able to name every one of them,&nbsp;and to list its special powers and principal fast days as well, by the time he&nbsp;was six. It hadn&#x2019;t been out of religious fervor. It had been simply because<i>&nbsp;</i>he had wanted to please the father he loved.&nbsp;<br><br>Ranjit remembered waking early in the morning when he was a small&nbsp;child, still living at home, and his father getting up at sunrise to bathe in the&nbsp;temple pool. He would see his father, naked to the waist as he faced the rising&nbsp;sun, and hear his long, reverberating Om. When he was a little older,&nbsp;Ranjit himself learned to say the mantra, and the location of the six parts&nbsp;of the body that he touched, and to offer water to the statues in the puja&nbsp;room. But then he went away to school. His religious observances were not&nbsp;required, and therefore ended. By the time he was ten, he knew he would&nbsp;never follow in his father&#x2019;s faith.&nbsp;<br><br>Not that his father&#x2019;s was not a fine profession. True, Ganesh Subramanian&#x2019;s&nbsp;temple was neither as ancient nor as vast as the one it had attempted&nbsp;to replace. Although it had been bravely given the same name as&nbsp;the original&#x2014;Tiru Koneswaram&#x2014;even its chief priest rarely called it anything&nbsp;but &#x201c;the new temple.&#x201d; It hadn&#x2019;t been completed until 1983, and in&nbsp;size it was not a patch on the original Tiru Koneswaram, the famous &#x201c;temple&nbsp;with a thousand columns,&#x201d; whose beginnings had been shrouded by&nbsp;two thousand years of history.&nbsp;<br><br>And then, when at last Ranjit was met, it was not by his father but by&nbsp;old Surash. He was apologetic. &#x201c;It is these pilgrims,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;So many of&nbsp;them! More than one hundred, and your father, the chief priest, is determined&nbsp;to greet each one. Go, Ranjit. Sit on Swami Rock and watch the sea.&nbsp;In an hour, perhaps, your father will join you there, but just now&#x2014;&#x201d; He&nbsp;sighed, and shook his head, and turned away to the task of helping his boss&nbsp;cope with the flood of pilgrims. Leaving Ranjit to his own resources.&nbsp;Which, as a matter of fact, was just fine, because for Ranjit an hour or so&nbsp;to himself on Swami Rock was a welcome gift.&nbsp;<br><br>An hour or so earlier Swami Rock would have been crowded with couples&nbsp;and whole families picnicking, sightseeing, or simply enjoying the&nbsp;cooling breeze that came off the Bay of Bengal. Now, with the sun lowering&nbsp;behind the hills to the west, it was almost deserted.&nbsp;<br><br>That was the way Ranjit preferred it. He loved Swami Rock. Had loved&nbsp;it all his life, in fact&#x2014;or no, he amended the thought, at six or seven he&nbsp;hadn&#x2019;t actually loved the rock itself nearly as much as he had the surrounding&nbsp;lagoons and beaches, where you could catch little star tortoises and&nbsp;make them race against one another.&nbsp;<i><br><br></i>But that was then. Now, at sixteen, he considered himself a fully adult&nbsp;man, and he had more important things to think about.&nbsp;<br><br>Ranjit found an unoccupied stone bench and leaned back, enjoying&nbsp;both the warmth of the setting sun at his back and the sea breeze on his&nbsp;face, as he prepared to think about the two subjects that were on his mind.&nbsp;The first, actually, took little thinking. Ranjit wasn&#x2019;t really disappointed&nbsp;at his father&#x2019;s absence. Ganesh had not told his sixteen- year- old&nbsp;son just what it was that he wanted to discuss. Ranjit, however, was depressingly&nbsp;confident that he knew what it was.&nbsp;<br><br>What it was was an embarrassment, and the worst part of it was that it&nbsp;was a wholly unnecessary one. It could have been avoided entirely if he&nbsp;had only remembered to lock his bedroom door so that the porter at his&nbsp;university lodgings would not have been able to blunder in on the two of&nbsp;them that afternoon. But Ranjit hadn&#x2019;t locked his door. The porter had indeed&nbsp;walked in on them, and Ranjit knew that Ganesh Subramanian had&nbsp;long since interviewed the man. He had talked to the porter only for the&nbsp;purpose, Ganesh would have said, of making sure that Ranjit lacked nothing&nbsp;he needed. But it did carry the collateral benefit of ensuring that&nbsp;Ganesh was kept well informed of what was going on in his son&#x2019;s life.&nbsp;Ranjit sighed. He would have wished to avoid the coming discussion.&nbsp;But he couldn&#x2019;t, and so he turned his attention to the second subject on his&nbsp;mind&#x2014;the important one&#x2014;the one that was nearly always at the top of his&nbsp;thoughts.&nbsp;<br><br>From his perch atop Swami Rock, a hundred meters above the restless&nbsp;waters of the Bay of Bengal, he looked eastward. On the surface, at twilight,&nbsp;there was nothing to see but water&#x2014;in fact nothing at all for more&nbsp;than a thousand kilometers, apart from a few scattered islands, until you&nbsp;reached the coast of Thailand. Tonight there had been a lull in the northea...</p><h2>Troia: Mexican Memoirs (American Literature Series)</h2><p><p>In this newly rediscovered memoir, Bonnie Bremser, ex-wife of Beat-poet Ray Bremser, chronicles her life on the run from the law in the early Sixties.

His articles have appeared in such scholarly publications as <em>Hebrew Annual Review, Journal of Biblical Literature</em>, and <em>Vetus Testamentum</em>.</p>ABOUT THE OLD TESTAMENT The Old Testament can be considered a book, a part of a book, and a collection of books. It is a book to the extent that its parts form a single whole. This book is often referred to today as the Hebrew Bible because it constitutes the Scripture of the Jewish people.As history progressed and Jesus Christ came, taught, died, and rose again, a whole new round of Scripture was formed to document the life of Christ and the rise of the church and to explore the theological and practical implications of what Christ had done.This New Testament was joined with the Old to become the Christian Bible, and so the Old Testament has become part of that book. We also understand that the Old Testament is a collection of books---thirty-nine books by various authors written over the span of a millennium. These books share a common religious perspective, but they vary widely in the types of literature they represent and the functions they serve. In the pages of these books the reader will find consideration of origins, tribal and national histories, collections of laws, collections of poetry, philosophical discussions, and prophetic sermons. But in all of these and through all of these, the reader will find theology---or, more appropriately put, God. Though the genres (types of literature) may vary, each is theological throughout. So, for instance, the discussion of origins is not about science; it is about God. The presentation of history is not concerned with facts or events in themselves; it is concerned with God&#39;s role. And perhaps most important, rather than simply being human thoughts and opinions about God, the Old Testament is God&#39;s presentation of himself, that is, his self-revelation. THE BIG STORY LINE/PLOTLINE God made the world operational and put people into it. Adam and Eve disobeyed his command, resulting in their being driven from the Garden of Eden. Thus begins the story of dislocation. Over time the &#39;Eden Problem,&#39; sin, became so pervasive that God sent a flood to destroy all but Noah and his family. The Tower of Babel represents the next step as people imagined that God had needs and saw themselves as providing the way for God to come down and have his needs met. This misperception of God can be called the &#39;Babel Problem.&#39; Consequently, God chose Abraham to be the ancestor of a chosen people through whom he would reveal himself and correct the distortion represented at Babel. He brought Abraham to the land of Canaan, where his family lived on the brink of extinction for three generations before going down to Egypt. There they lived for more than four hundred years and became a large nation. God brought them out of great oppression in Egypt, and they began their journey back to the land of Canaan, the Promised Land. After stopping at Mount Sinai, where Moses received the law---God&#39;s next phase in revealing himself---they were waylaid in the wilderness for a generation because they lacked the faith to let God lead them into the land. Under the command of Joshua, the Israelites returned to the land and, in a series of battles, God won them control of the land. Joshua divided the land among the tribes, and they began to settle in. Over the next several centuries, known as the period of the judges, there was no king. Each tribe had its own tribal leadership, but they constantly fell prey to the surrounding nations.God allowed this because of the failure of the Israelites to be faithful to God in their beliefs. Finally, the people initiated a move to a monarchy form of government. The first attempt, in which Saul was crowned king, failed because of unrealistic and theologically misguided expectations of the king and his role. At his death, Israel was just as bad off politically and spiritually as when he came to the throne. The second attempt was more successful. David was chosen by the Lord to be king, his dynasty became established through a covenant with the Lord, and Jerusalem was made the capital city. As the empire of David expanded, Israel finally came into control of the land that had been promised to Abraham nearly a millennium earlier. He successfully passed this empire to his son Solomon, but Solomon&#39;s misjudgments and excesses in both political and theological terms eroded the empire as well as the support of the people. After Solomon&#39;s death in 931 BC, his son Rehoboam retained control of only a small section of the kingdom from Jerusalem south, while God gave a new dynasty control of the much larger northern kingdom. The southern kingdom was now designated &#39;Judah,&#39; and the northern kingdom, under Jeroboam,was designated Israel. For just over two hundred years, this situation continued. The Davidic dynasty remained in control in Judah, while the northern kingdom, Israel, experienced a series of dynastic lines. When the Assyrians extended their control across the ancient world in the middle of the eighth century, Israel joined a coalition against the Assyrians and eventually lost the war. The capital city, Samaria, was destroyed in 722 BC, and the northern kingdom was assimilated into the Assyrian Empire. Judah remained an independent nation but was for the most part under Assyrian control. During this time there were kings who were faithful to the Lord (such as Hezekiah), but for the middle fifty-five years, Manasseh forged a regime that accepted not only Assyrian rule, but foreign religious practice as well. The Assyrian Empire lasted for another century until it weakened and was taken over by the Medes and the Babylonians. Already as the Assyrian Empire receded, the prophetic voices in Judah, such as Jeremiah, were calling on the people to return to the Lord and were warning of impending doom at the hands of the Babylonians. The Assyrian Empire breathed its last gasp in the fall of Carchemish in 605 BC, and the Babylonians began to exert their control into Judah. For several years it was uncertain whether Babylon or Egypt would have the greatest influence, and the kings of Judah rocked back and forth. Eventually Babylon prevailed as the army under Nebuchadnezzar moved west to punish the rebellious King Jehoiakim. His son Jehoiachin was taken into exile in Babylon along with many others in the administration, but the kingdom was left intact. In the next decade, however, the lure of rebellion became too strong, and King Zedekiah joined a conspiracy against the Babylonians. This time there was no mercy. The result of the Babylonian invasion in 587 was the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, the massive deportation of the Israelites, and the incorporation of Judah as a Babylonian province. The prophets&#39; warnings had come to pass, and for the first time in more than four hundred years, there was no king on David&#39;s throne. The seventy years that were spent in exile were given very little treatment in the text. Prophetic voices such as Ezekiel and Daniel continued to speak, but no historical literature discussed the situation in either Israel or Babylon. When the Babylonian Empire fell to the Persian king Cyrus in 539 BC, a new policy of tolerance allowed the exiles to return to Israel and rebuild their temple. In this postexilic period they had no king, but a governor ruled the small state of Yehud on behalf of the Persian king. Under the leadership of individuals such as Ezra and Nehemiah, the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt and the people recommitted themselves to the covenant and the Lord. Yet they remained a state under Persian rule until Alexander the Great overthrew the Persians and they became part of another empire. As Daniel had indicated, empire followed empire as the people waited for their deliverance and the return of a Davidic king, their Messiah.1 FUNDAMENTALS</p><h2>Walter Johnson: Baseball&#39;s Big Train</h2><p>A biography of the early twentieth-century star who is often considered the best pitcher in the history of major league baseball</p><p>How good a pitcher was Washington Senator ace Walter Johnson? Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, and Joe Jackson considered him the best ever. His career strikeout record lasted for half a century, and no one's ever come close to his mark of 110 shutouts; some of his Senator teams were so bad, the only way Johnson could win was literally to keep opponents from scoring. Of course, the numbers alone don't tell the story. Johnson was a towering figure in the first quarter of the baseball century. One of the most respected--and liked--men in the game, he was something of an anti-Cobb: straight, honest, and clean, with a life off the field as content as it was accomplished on it. This is an excellent, exhaustive biography, showing clear affection for Johnson from the first pitch: Thomas is Johnson's grandson. Despite the blood tie, Thomas doesn't just go straight down the middle; he is willing to work the corners of his grandfather's life, which actually allows his relationship to his subject to add to the work's significant depth. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i>Henry W. Thomas, the grandson of Walter Johnson, lives in Arlington, Virginia. He is currently editing, for audio release, the interviews taped by Lawrence Ritter for&nbsp;his classic <i>The Glory of Their Times</i>.

I was getting my life back on track. I had a job, writing features for the <i>Daily Fluxion</i>. I had a place to live, an apartment on the ground floor of an old mansion. And soon I would be getting a roommate! </p><p> My landlord, who was art critic for the <i>Fluxion</i>, lived upstairs with his art treasures and a Siamese called Kao K'o Kung. Although I knew nothing about cats, I was enlisted for cat-sitting when the critic was out of town. </p><p> He wrote his reviews at home and never went near the news office. According to conventional wisdom, he never went near the art galleries either, but wrote his nasty criticism off the top of his head. Among local artists he was well hated, to coin a phrase. So no one was surprised when he was murdered in his own backyard. </p><p> That was the first time I heard the cat's "death howl," a bloodcurdling experience! </p><p> Kao K'o Kung-that smart cat!-then walked downstairs and moved in with me. I recall giving him some turkey from the Press Club that I had been saving for myself. </p><p> So here we were! Thrown together by fate! First thing I did, I changed his name to Koko. </p><p> He made no objection. He knew which side his bread was buttered on! In the days that followed we invented games to play, both athletic and intellectual. I was at work all day but made up for it by reading to him every evening-either the <i>Daily Fluxion</i> or the dictionary; he was not particular. </p><p> Then I began to find fault with the old mansion. It seemed to be the ancestral domain of a dynasty of moths, which were eating holes in my bathrobe and neckties. But where could I move? Apartments in my price range specified "no pets allowed." I discussed the problem with Koko, who listened thoughtfully. I told him that a friend of mine was going to Europe for three months and had suggested that I house-sit. Koko squeezed his eyes. We were getting to be pals. Then, to my surprise, he turned out be a self-appointed bodyguard and somewhat of a bloodhound! </p><p> One day he wanted to go upstairs to his old haunt. The murdered man's treasures had been removed, but I had a key to the apartment and the supply of cat litter. But that cat seemed to have his own urgent reason; he ran up and down the stairs ahead of me in anticipation. </p><p> Sure enough, there was a large tapestry still hanging in a hallway, and Koko was determined to paw his way behind it. When I went to his assistance, I discovered a door back there, which the landlord had found it advisable to conceal. It led downstairs to a small ground-floor apartment in the rear of the building, and it was filled with clues to the recent crime. It had been used as an artist's studio and still had an odor of turpentine. </p><p> Just as I was snooping around in amazement and Koko was getting some kind of early high from the paintbrushes, I heard a key turn in the rear door leading to the backyard, and a big man walked in. For a moment we were both frozen in surprise. Then he looked about wildly, grabbed a palette knife, and came at me! </p><p> Before I could find a chair to swing at him, Koko threw a catfit! The room seemed filled with snarling animals, attacking him from all sides with claws extended! I was able to clobber the guy, and we left him on the floor while we called the police. Koko spent the next few hours licking </p><p> his claws. </p><p> * * * </p><p> </p><p> I was glad to move into my friend's posh apartment on the fifteenth floor of the Villa Verandah. Koko seemed happy, too. I think he liked the view. Then one day I came home from work and found a large hole in the green wool upholstery of a fine wing chair. As I examined it, with horror, Koko jumped onto the chair seat and upchucked a green fur ball-still moist! </p><p> I immediately phoned the Press Club bartender, who always had the answer to all questions. </p><p> He listened and said wisely, "Sounds like an emotional problem. You need a psycatatrist. I can tell you where to find one." </p><p> It sounded like a hoax, especially since the address he gave me was on the edge of the red-light district. And I was even more suspicious when I phoned for an appointment and was told to come alone without the cat ... but I was desperate! I reported for the consultation. </p><p> It was a tawdry house, but there were cats on every windowsill, and that was promising. I was welcomed by a kindly woman in a faded housedress accompanied by at least a dozen cats who seemed quite well adjusted. She ushered me into the parlor and gave me a cup of tea with the inevitable cat hair floating in it. No matter. </p><p> What I learned, after stating the problem, was this: Siamese, when troubled, become wool eaters. My ties and bathrobe were undoubtedly wool. Koko was lonely because he was accustomed to having someone at home all day. He needed a nice little Siamese female for a companion. Neutering would make no difference. They would be quite sweet to each other.... I found this concept extremely interesting. </p><p> Now all I had to do was find a little female Siamese.... </p><p> Panic time! Here I was-a lifelong cat illiterate-involved in matchmaking between temperamental Siamese! I phoned the Press Club bartender for advice once more. </p><p> "Call the catteries listed in the Yellow Pages," he said with authority. "Check the classified ads in the paper. Call the pet hospitals!" </p><p> I did. My efforts turned up only one available candidate, and the asking price was more than my weekly paycheck at the <i>Fluxion</i>. I was just getting back on my feet financially. I needed to make a down payment on a used car. </p><p> Meanwhile I was afraid to leave Koko alone in the borrowed apartment; he might start eating the rugs! Once, as a test, I shut him up in the bathroom, and he howled so continuously and with such volume that there were five complaints to the manager. </p><p> Someone suggested selling Koko; it would solve the whole problem. </p><p> I considered that unthinkable. Already I felt a kinship with him that was hard to explain. </p><p> I'll never forget the frantic search for a companion who would stop Koko from eating wool! </p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><h2>Riders of the Purple Sage / To the Last Man / The Thundering Herd / The Hash Knife Outfit / West of the Pecos</h2><p>Five Complete Novels of the American West, by the great Zane Grey (1872-1939): Riders of the Purple Sage, To the Last Man, The Thundering Herd, The Hash Knife Outfit, and West of the Pecos. With thrilling poignancy Zane Grey recreates those turbulent years when dispossessed Indians fought savagely to protect their hunting grounds, when buffalo fell by the thousands to the white man&#39;s bullets, and when men and women struggled to seize this wild and beautiful land and make it their own. Grey knew intimately and loved passionately the country he immortalized in these magnificent novels. Red-rimmed canyons, purple sage, vast Texas prairies, hidden streams, and waterfalls form an incredibly rich background for his vibrant frontier tales. In Riders of the Purple Sage, a tragic past blights the life of a beautiful, wealthy woman and reaches even more strangely into the fortunes of the elusive masked rider of the purple sage. To the Last Man is a novel of blazing guns, swift horses, and fearless men who hang on until the bitter end. Men risk their lives in The Thundering Herd to make a quick fortune from the hide of the noble buffalo. Can a tenderfoot from Missouri outsmart and outfight the most dangerous band of desperadoes in the land- The Hash Knife Outfit? The lawless land West of the Pecos was no place for an aristocratic young woman, even one trained to ride and shoot like a man. Here is the American West-- glorious, squalid pitiless, unforgettable.</p><p></p><h2>Something in the Water</h2><p>Peter Shandy, the botanist-sleuth from The Corpse in Oozak&#39;s Pond, discovers deception during a field trip, when a man is poisoned and the locals seek out the murderer--to give proper thanks. 35,000 first printing. Tour.</p><p><p>Charlotte MacLeod (1922-2005) was an internationally bestselling author of cozy mysteries. Born in Canada, she moved to Boston as a child, and lived in New England most of her life. After graduating from college, she made a career in advertising, writing copy for the Stop &amp; Shop Supermarket Company before moving on to Boston firm N. H. Miller &amp; Co., where she rose to the rank of vice president. In her spare time, MacLeod wrote short stories, and in 1964 published her first novel, a children's book called Mystery of the White Knight.&nbsp;</p> <p></p>Despite its goofy plot, cast of caricatures, digressions and lack of suspense, MacLeod's lively mystery lampoon set in coastal Maine, where she lives, will surely please her myriad fans. Jasper Flodge, a loutish dinner guest at Bright's Inn, abruptly expires onto his recently cleaned plate of chicken pot pie and is pronounced dead of cyanide poisoning. The only other diners at the time are Peter Shandy, professor of botany at Balaclava Agricultural College and unofficial "sleuth-for-all-seasons," who was seen most recently in An Owl Too Many , and elderly Claridge Withington, an avid amateur horticulturist who reminds Shandy of the Ancient Mariner. Shandy proceeds to unravel a devious scam involving unloved, miserly Flodge, the flamboyant woman claiming to be his widow, and two others. He figures out the murderer and the suitably loony method. But he nevers solves the mystery that has drawn him from his native Massachusetts to Maine: Why do the lupines growing in the rocky soil of nearby Rondel's Head bloom so gloriously? And what keeps their nonagenarian nurturer, Frances Rondel, so spry? MacLeod has good sport with the laconic reputation of Maine residents, but this arch humor, no matter how fond, will likely appeal most to MacLeod followers.

She is a lifetime member of the exclusive Knickerbocker Association of New York City, and her work has appeared in The Artist&#39;s Magazine, American Artist and Southwest Art.How can light create the illusions of depth on a 2-dimensional plane? How does rendering the subtleties of light suggest all-important mood and atmosphere in a painting? Well-known artist Carr provides a lavishly illustrated, step-by-step guide starting with, appropriately, learning to see. "Think like a sculptor," she advises, simplifying forms into their basic 3-dimensional shapes enveloped by various kinds of light. When progressing to color, she emphasizes focusing the center of interest by using contrasting values to route the viewer's eye by following the light. Using different lighting situations as full-color examples, she demonstrates refraction, gradation, and more, then analyzes compositional elements before even beginning the brushwork. Exercises using identical subjects compare and contrast the uses of watercolors and oils. <i>Whitney Scott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yes, the Luftwaffe and Vengeance weapons had made a fine mess in the south of the country, but during the war years the Yanks were there, millions of them, seducing the womenfolk, brawling in pubs, and, most importantly, spending their pay with local shopkeepers. May, 1945, the war ended and all the Americans left. Most went home, but a sizeable contingent set up shop in Germany, where, to the best of their ability given the local ruins, they carried on as before, seducing the womenfolk, brawling in pubs and spending their pay with the surviving shopkeepers. The Americans were joined by contingents of English, French and Soviet troops. As a result, the surprising fact, long forgotten, is that after the war, conditions in England were even worse than they were in post-Third Reich Germany. Some in Britain rued winning the war, as deprivation became their fate. In London after the war books were so scarce that used vendors had long lists of people waiting for the few books that turned up. For schools in London which taught astrology, the situation was impossible. Responding to the post WWII book shortage, Margaret Hone published this ultimate Astrology Text-Book. She was born in Birmingham, England, on October 2, 1892, at 2:13 am. Her ascendant was 27 Leo; her Sun was 9 Libra; her Moon was 13 Aquarius. Her midheaven was 15 Taurus. Of Ms Hone, James Holden wrote, &#34;English astrologer, educator, and author. She was a professional astrologer and private teacher for many years and later was Principal and Director of Studies of the Faculty of Astrological Studies 1954-1969 and Vice President of the Astrological Lodge of London. Mrs. Hone was an advocate of the Equal House system of house division. She is best known in the U.S. for her two instruction manuals.&#34; This book is dedicated to Charles E.O. Carter, 1887-1968. Carter succeeded Alan Leo as head of the Astrological Lodge (1920-1952) and was First Principal of the Faculty of Astrological Studies, which he helped found in 1948. Hone succeeded Carter at FAS. She passed away on October 14, 1969. In his Preface, while quick to praise Hone, a personal friend, Charles Carter also pointed out that this book&#39;s high price was justified, that &#34;padding has been rigorously excluded.&#34; He goes on to praise the workmanship, the carefully worded definitions, as well as the fact that the book was complete and entire in itself. Save for ephemeris and tables of houses, this one book would suffice beginning as well as advanced students for some years. In addition, Hone also includes one of the earliest modern histories of astrology, short biographies of leading astrologers past and present, astrology and public opinion (daily horoscopes in the newspapers were a recent innovation). On a more practical side, Hone gives a thorough analysis of the principal house systems of the day (Equal, Campanus, Regiomontanus, Placidus), and even mentions C.G. Jung&#39;s recently developed Depth Psychology.</p><p>Margaret Hone was born in Birmingham, England, on October 2, 1892, at 2:13 am.

Michael Rowe understands that while it gets better for some people, not everyone can afford to sit back and wait if they want to survive.

The ghosts are also real in Rowe, this time in the visage of Rosa Blackmore, a spectral teenager who makes known her presence in grim, strobic flashes around the estate. And yet, as in all the best haunted house stories, the specter in Wild Fell is more than just that; it&#x2019;s a powerful human emotion made flesh&#x2015;or un-flesh, as the case may be.

We think of the wonderful dishes that we have prepared in our lifetimes and think, "Can that dish be as good on the grill--or even better?" And then we try to create a truly wonderful grilled dish.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> We both love to garden as well. We love the look of our gardens (most of the time). We talk about what we will do differently next season and what new crop we want to try.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> We both garden differently, however.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Karen's garden mimics the French "potager" (<b>r</b>aised-bed in a pattern) style with an emphasis--a BIG EMPHASIS--on tomatoes of every type. She also grows herbs, fruits, and vegetables. <br> &nbsp;<br> Judith's garden is more edible landscaping and container gardening with baby turnips, rhubarb, melons, Italian plum tomatoes, and baby lettuces amongst the pear trees, raspberries, roses, and lavender. <br> &nbsp;<br> In our book, <b>The Gardener and the Grill</b>, we've figured out a way to grill just about any garden goodie, from asparagus to strawberries, apples to sugar snap peas--even edamame!<br><br> Gardening and grilling are all about having foods you like. You might grow pots of patio tomatoes because you love the taste of fresh-picked. Or you might grow fava beans because they're difficult to find fresh in the pod in your area. &nbsp;Likewise, you grill foods because that cooking process makes them taste better.<br> &nbsp;<br> "Garden to grill" cooking emphasizes sustainability, freshness, taste, color, and texture. Grilling from the garden also gives you twice the sense of accomplishment--first from growing your own food, and secondly, from making it taste so good. <br> &nbsp;<br> It doesn't get any fresher than picking ears of corn, then grilling them a few minutes later, slathered with a flavored butter.&nbsp; Mmmmm.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br> Or arrange a platter of grilled vegetables around a bowl of dipping sauce, and watch them disappear. Toss a large bunch of seedless grapes on the grill, then turn with tongs once each side has good grill marks--grilled grapes are wonderful to serve on a platter with a cinnamon and sugar cr�me fraiche.<br><br><b>The Gardener and the Grill</b> has lots more simple and delicious ways to enjoy your garden and your grill all year 'round.

He was not a prude, but, nonetheless, it made him wince. He worked with children all day, taught a kind of aerobics to pre-schoolers, and the most extreme language he was likely to hear seemed to him to be in code, in acronyms, or maybe even in German--boo-boo, finky, peenick--words that were difficult to figure out even in context, and words, therefore, from which he felt quite safe. He suspected it was not unlike people he knew who hated operas in translation. &#34;Believe me,&#34; they would explain, &#34;you just don&#39;t want to know what they&#39;re saying.&#34;Today they were talking about families.&#34;Fathers and sons,&#34; she said, &#34;they&#39;re like governments: always having sword fights with their penises.&#34;&#34;Really,&#34; said Gerard, sitting at her kitchen table, gulping at near-beer for breakfast. He palmed his beard like a man trying to decide.&#34;But what do I know.&#34; She smiled and shrugged. &#34;I grew up in a trailer. It&#39;s not like a real family with a house.&#34; This was her excuse for everything, her own self-deprecating refrain; she&#39;d grown up in a trailer in upstate New York and was therefore unqualified to pronounce on any of the subjects she continued to pronounce on.Gerard had his own line of self-excuse: &#34;I was a retard in my father&#39;s play.&#34;&#34;A retard in your father&#39;s play?&#34;&#34;Yes,&#34; he said, realizing that faced with the large questions of life and not finding large answers, one must then settle for makeshift, little answers, just as on any given day a person must at least eat something, even if it was not marvelous and huge. &#34;He wrote plays in our town. Then he did the casting and directing. It was harder to venture out through the rest of life after that.&#34;&#34;How awful for you,&#34; said Benna, pouring more near-beer into both their glasses.&#34;Yes,&#34; he said. He loved her very much.Benna was a nightclub singer. Four nights a week she put on a black mini-dress and what she wearily called her Joan-Crawford-catch-me-have-me shoes, and went off to sing at the various cocktail lounges around Fitchville. Sometimes Gerard would go see her and drink too much. In the spotlight up front she seemed to him hopelessly beautiful, a star, her glass jewelry launching quasars into the audience, her laughter rumbling into the mike. He&#39;d watch other men fall in love with her; he knew the fatuous gaze, the free drinks sent over between songs--he&#39;d done that himself. Sometimes he would stay for all three sets and buy her a hamburger afterward or just give her a ride home. Other times, when it was crowded, he would leave her to her fans--the businessmen with loosened neckties, the local teenage girls who idolized her, the very musicians she hired to play with her--and would go home and sit in his bathroom, in his bone-dry tub, with his clothes on, waiting. The way their apartments were laid out, their bathrooms shared a wall, and Gerard could sit in his own tub and await her two-in-the-morning return, hear her enter her bathroom, hear her pee, hear the ruckle of the toilet-paper roll, the metal-sprung flush, the sliding shower door, the squirt, spray, hiss of the water. Sometimes he would call to her through the tiles. She would turn off the shower and yell, &#34;Gerard, are you talking to me?&#34;&#34;Yes, I&#39;m talking to you. No. I&#39;m talking to Zero Mostel.&#34;&#34;Listen, I&#39;m tired. I&#39;m going to bed.&#34;Once she came home at three in the morning, completely drunk, and knocked on his door. When he opened it, she was slumped against the frame, eyes closed, shoes in hand. &#34;Gerard,&#34; she drawled, thrusting her shoes at him, &#34;will you make love to me?&#34; and then she sank to the floor and passed out.Every morning she downed a whole six-pack of near-beer. &#34;You know, I&#39;m a widow,&#34; she said, and then told him quickly about a husband, a lawyer who had been killed in a car crash.&#34;You&#39;re so young,&#34; murmured Gerard. &#34;It must have been devastating.&#34;&#34;Nah,&#34; she exhaled, and then, peeling an orange, sang &#34;O what a beautiful mourning,&#34; just that line. &#34;I don&#39;t know,&#34; she said, and shrugged.Near their apartment building was a large baseball field, rarely used. From Gerard&#39;s living-room window he could see the field&#39;s old rotting scoreboard, weathered as driftwood, its paint peeling but still boasting the neat and discernible lettering: HOME and VISITOR. When he&#39;d first moved into the apartment, the words seemed to mock him--scoring, underscoring, his own displacement and aloneness--so much that he would close the blinds so as not to have to look at them.Occasionally now, however, late at night, he would venture out onto the diamond and, if it was summer and warm, would sprawl out on the ground at a place just to the left of the pitcher&#39;s mound and stare up at the sky. It was important to dizzy yourself with stars, he thought. Too often you forgot they were even there. He could stare at one star, one brilliant and fidgety star, so long that his whole insides seemed suddenly to rush out into the sky to meet it. It was like the feeling he&#39;d had as a boy playing baseball, focusing on the pitched ball with such concentration that the bat itself seemed at the crucial moment to leap from him with a loud smack and greet the ball mid-air.As an adult he rarely had those moments of connection, though what ones he&#39;d had recently seemed mostly to be with the children he taught. He&#39;d be showing them how to do reaches and bends--like trees, he would tell them--and when he put on music and finally had them do it, their eyes would cry &#34;Look at me! I&#39;m doing it!&#34; the sudden bonds between them and him magical as home runs. More and more he was becoming convinced that it was only through children that one could connect with anything anymore, that in this life it was only through children that one came home, became a home, that one was no longer a visitor.&#34;Boy, are you sentimental,&#34; Benna told him. &#34;I feel like I&#39;m talking to a Shirley Temple movie.&#34; Benna was a woman who knew when she was ovulating by the dreams she&#39;d have of running through corridors to catch trains; she was also a woman who said she had no desire to have children. &#34;I watched my friend Eleanor give birth,&#34; she said. &#34;Once you&#39;ve seen a child born you realize a baby&#39;s not much more than a reconstituted ham and cheese sandwich. Just a little anagram of you and what you&#39;ve been eating for nine months.&#34;&#34;But look at the stars,&#34; he wanted to say to her. &#34;How does one get there?&#34; But then he thought of her singing in the Ramada Inn cocktail lounge, her rhinestones flashing out into the dark of the place, and thought that maybe in a certain way she was already there. &#34;Tell me why you don&#39;t want to have children,&#34; Gerard asked her. He had for a solid week recently allowed himself the fantasy of someday having a family with her, although she had shown no real interest in him after that one night in his doorway, and usually went out with other men anyway. He would sometimes hear them clunk up and down the stairs.&#34;You know me,&#34; she said. &#34;I grew up in a trailer. Your own father made you a retard. You tell me why you want to have kids.&#34;Gerard thought about the little deaf boy in his class, a boy named Barney, how just today Barney had said loudly in his garbled and unconsonanted speech, &#34;Please, Mr. Maines, when you stand behind, can you stomp your feet louder?&#34; The only way Barney could hear the music and the beat was through the vibrations in the floor. Gerard had smiled, kind and hearty, and said &#34;Certainly, young man,&#34; and something raced and idled in his heart.&#34;Sometimes I think that without children we remain beasts or dust. That we are like something lost at sea.Benna looked at him and blinked, her eyes almost swelling, as if with allergy. She took a long glug of near-beer, swallowed, then shrugged. &#34;Do you?&#34; she said. &#34;I think maybe I&#39;m just too exhausted from work.&#34;&#34;Yes, well,&#34; said Gerard, attempting something lighthearted. &#34;I guess that&#39;s why they call it work. I guess that&#39;s why they don&#39;t call it table tennis.&#34;&#34;What are you watching?&#34; Gerard had knocked on her door and sauntered in. Benna was curled under a blanket on the sofa, watching television. Gerard tried to smile, had even been practicing it, feeling the air on his teeth, his cheeks puff up into his vision, the slight rise of his ears up the sides of his head.&#34;Some science-fiction thing,&#34; she said. &#34;Escape from something. Or maybe it&#39;s invasion of something. I forget.&#34;&#34;Who are those figures rimmed in neon?&#34; he asked, sitting beside her.&#34;Those are the love-killers. They love you and then they kill you. They&#39;re from another planet. Supposedly.&#34;He looked at her face. It was pale, without make-up, and the narrow planes of her cheeks seemed exquisite as bone. Her hair, pulled off her face into a rubber band, shone auburn in the lamplight. Just as she was, huddled in a blanket that had telltale signs of dog hair and coffee, Gerard wanted more than anything else to hold her in his arms. And so, in a kind of rush out of himself, he leaned over and kissed Benna on the mouth.&#34;Gerard,&#34; she said, pulling away slightly. &#34;I like you very much, but I&#39;m just not feeling sexual these days.&#34;He could feel the dry chap of her lips against his, still there, like a ten-second ghost. &#34;You go out with men,&#34; he insisted, quickly hating the tone of his own voice. &#34;I hear them.&#34;&#34;Look. I&#39;m going through life alone now,&#34; she said. &#34;I can&#39;t think of men or penises or marriage or children. I work too hard. I don&#39;t even masturbate.&#34;Gerard sank into the back of the sofa, feeling himself about to speak something bitter, something that tomorrow he would apologize for. What he said was, &#34;What, do you need an audience for everything?&#34; And without waiting for a reply, he got up to return to his own apartment where VISITOR and HOME, like a rigged and age-old game, would taunt him even through the blinds. He stood and went back across the hall, where he lived.2STRINGS TOO SHORT TO USEALTHOUGH I WAS BETWEEN JOBS and afraid I would slip into the cracks and pauses of two different Major Medical policies, I was pleased when they said I had a lump in my breast. I had discovered it on my own, during a home check, had counted to twenty and checked again, and even though Gerard had kept saying, &#34;Where? There? Is that what you mean? It feels muscular,&#34; I brought it in to them.&#34;Yes,&#34; the nurse-practitioner said. &#34;Yes. There&#39;s a lump in your breast.&#34;&#34;Yes, there is,&#34; said the surgeon standing beside her like a best man.&#34;Thank you,&#34; I said. &#34;Thank you very much.&#34; I sat up and put my clothes back on. The surgeon had pictures of his wife and kids on the wall. The whole family looked like it was in high school, pretty and young. I stared at them and thought, So? I slipped my shoes on, zipped up my fly, tried not to feel somehow like a hooker.This is why I was pleased: The lump was not simply a focal point for my self-pity; it was also a battery propelling me, strengthening me--my very own appointment with death. It anchored and deepened me like a secret. I started to feel it when I walked, just out from under my armpit--hard, achy evidence that I was truly a knotted saint, a bleeding angel. At last it had been confirmed: My life was really as difficult as I had always suspected. &#34;It&#39;s true. It&#39;s there,&#34; I said to Gerard when I got home.&#34;Who&#39;s there?&#34; he muttered, preoccupied and absent as a landlord. He was singing the part of Aeneas in a local production of his own rock opera, and he was on his way downtown to shop for sandals &#34;that sort of crawl up the leg.&#34;&#34;This is not a knock-knock joke, Gerard. The lump. The lump is there. It&#39;s now a certified lump.&#34;&#34;Oh,&#34; he said slowly, soft and bewildered. &#34;Oh, baby.&#34;I bought big stretchy bras--one size fits all, catches all, ropes all in and presses all against you. I started to think of myself as more than one organism: a symbiotic system, like a rhino and an oxpecker, or a gorgonzola cheese.Gerard and I lived across the hall from one another. Together we had the entire top floor of a small red house on Marini Street. We could prop the doors open with bricks and sort of float back and forth between our two apartments, and although most of the time we would agree that we were living together, other times I knew it wasn&#39;t the same. He had moved to Marini Street after I&#39;d been there three years, his way of appeasing my desire to discuss our future. At that point we&#39;d been lovers for nineteen months. The year before he&#39;d unilaterally decided to go on living on the other side of town, in a large &#34;apartment in the forest.&#34; (He called my place &#34;the cottage in the city.&#34;) It was too expensive, but, he said, all wise sparkle, &#34;far enough away to be lovely,&#34; though I never knew what he thought was lovely at that distance--himself or me or the apartment. Perhaps it was the view. Gerard, I was afraid, liked the world best at a distance, as a photograph, as a memory. He liked to kiss me, nuzzle me, when I was scarcely awake and aware--corpse-like with the flu or struck dumb with fatigue. He liked having to chisel at some remove to get to me.&#34;He&#39;s a sexist pig,&#34; said Eleanor.&#34;Maybe he&#39;s just a latent necrophiliac,&#34; I said, realizing afterward that probably they were the same thing.&#34;Lust for dust,&#34; shrugged Eleanor. &#34;Into a cold one after work.&#34;So we never had the ritual of discussion, decision, and apartment hunting. It was simply that the Indian couple across the hall broke their lease and Gerard suddenly said during the Carson monologue one night, &#34;Hey, maybe I&#39;ll move in there. It might be cheaper than the forest.&#34;We had separate rents, separate kitchens, separate phone numbers, separate bathrooms with back-to-back toilets. Sometimes he&#39;d knock on the wall and ask through the pipes how I was doing. &#34;Fine, Gerard. Just fine.&#34;</p><h2>How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents</h2><p>The Garc�as&#x2014;Dr. Carlos (Papi), his wife Laura (Mami), and their four daughters, Carla, Sandra, Yolanda, and Sof�a&#x2014;belong to the uppermost echelon of Spanish Caribbean society, descended from the conquistadores. Their family compound adjoins the <i>palacio</i> of the dictator&#x2019;s daughter. So when Dr. Garc�a&#x2019;s part in a coup attempt is discovered, the family must flee. <br><br>They arrive in New York City in 1960 to a life far removed from their existence in the Dominican Republic. Papi has to find new patients in the Bronx. Mami, far from the compound and the family retainers, must find herself. Meanwhile, the girls try to <i>lose</i> themselves&#x2014;by forgetting their Spanish, by straightening their hair and wearing fringed bell bottoms. For them, it is at once liberating and excruciating being caught between the old world and the new, trying to live up to their father&#x2019;s version of honor while accommodating the expectations of their American boyfriends. Acclaimed writer Julia Alvarez&#x2019;s brilliant and buoyant first novel sets the Garc�a girls free to tell their most intimate stories about how they came to be at home&#x2014;and not at home&#x2014;in America.<br></p><p>Julia Alvarez left the Dominican Republic for the United States in 1960 at the age of ten. She is the author of six novels, two books of nonfiction, three collections of poetry, and eight books for children and young adults. Her work has garnered wide recognition, including a Latina Leader Award in Literature in 2007 from the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute, the 2002 Hispanic Heritage Award in Literature, the<br>2000 Woman of the Year by <i>Latina</i> magazine, and inclusion in the New York Public Library&#x2019;s 1996 program &#x201c;The Hand of the Poet: Original Manuscripts by 100 Masters, from John Donne to Julia Alvarez.&#x201d; A writer-in-residence at Middlebury College, Alvarez and her husband, Bill Eichner, established Alta Gracia, an organic coffee farm&#x2013;literacy arts center, in her homeland, the Dominican Republic.<br>Alvarez's poetic prose, with its rich, sensual detail, is brought perfectly to life by five readers. With expressive voices and accents that move adeptly between English and Spanish, they narrate the interwoven stories of four daughters of a wealthy family forced to leave the Dominican Republic and settle in the United States. Adjustment to immigrant life and its long-term consequences is explored with psychological astuteness from the point of view of each sister. Oddly, the narrators' voices are similar, making it difficult to distinguish among them, although this doesn't detract from the pleasures of listening. The rich detail, emotional depth, and fine narration make this a book that invites multiple listenings.

Through multiple narrators, readers are exposed to successive generations of the Burroughs clan and the mountain in the Georgia backwoods that they consider theirs. An outlaw attitude with brutal rules about right and wrong, where wrong can make you dead, is passed on from father to son until the present generation that somehow includes one son who joins the law. The family&#x2019;s land has provided an illegal income dating from the time of running moonshine to the meth labs of 2015, and while violent and harsh there is a simplicity to their way of being in the world that is hard to look away from. <em>Bull Mountain</em> is an intense and expertly told multigenerational story of blood ties, and bonds stronger than kinship, how the sins of fathers are borne by their sons, and what happens when someone down the line wants redemption--or revenge. <em>--Seira Wilson</em></p>2<b>Brian Panowich</b> was a touring musician for twelve years before settling in East Georgia with his family.&nbsp; He now works full-time as a firefighter.&nbsp; Bull Mountain is his first novel.</p><h2>The Bears&#39; Famous Invasion of Sicily (New York Review Children&#39;s Collection)</h2><p>Dino Buzzati&#39;s classic tale chronicles the terrible winter that sent the starving bears down into the valley in search of food, as well as their struggles with an army of wild boars, a wily professor who may or may not be a magician, snarling Marmoset the Cat, and, worse still, treachery within their own ranks.

Fuchida was responsible for the coordination of the entire aerial attack working under the overall fleet commander Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo. After World War II ended, Fuchida became an evangelist, Christian preacher and frequently traveled to the United States to minister to the Japanese expatriate community. He became a United States citizen in 1966. His autobiography was originally released in 1953, and this edition will be published to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 2011.</p></p><p>Fuchida--a former captain in the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service&#x2014;tells an epic tale of war and religion, and how the two eventually lead him to a career as a Christian preacher in the United States after WWII. His story is indeed an incredible one: Fuchida led the attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. But following the war, he ''surrendered his heart to Jesus Christ'' and transformed himself from ''a soldier of pain to a soldier of love.''

E. Modesitt, Jr., is the bestselling author of the fantasy series The Saga of Recluce, Corean Chronicles, and the Imager Portfolio. His science fiction includes <i>Adiamante</i>, the Ecolitan novels, the Forever Hero Trilogy, and <i>Archform: Beauty</i>. Besides a writer, Modesitt has been a U.S. Navy pilot, a director of research for a political campaign, legislative assistant and staff director for a U.S. Congressman, Director of Legislation and Congressional Relations for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, a consultant on environmental, regulatory, and communications issues, and a college lecturer. He lives in Cedar City, Utah.</p>There is little to distinguish this newest Recluce work (after Towers of the Sunset ) from its myriad fantasy brethren. This time around, Modessit's world of Order (Black) and Chaos (White) features the plodding Dorrin, a healer/engineer who dreams of making machines and often denies what other people consider his extraordinary abilities. When the White Wizards of Chaos threaten the area of the world to which the Order-based Dorrin has been exiled to "find himself," he uses his engineering talents to design and build weaponry and his dreamed-of machines. Modesitt's prose lacks the range to make his rather pedestrian narrative interesting: more than a few events are unnecessarily telegraphed to readers several chapters before they happen, and the same character often--irritatingly--described three different ways within a few paragraphs. The most effective moments are those depicting the troubled relationship between Dorrin and a woman named Liedral. There's not much else to sustain the reader. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The English Year: From Diaries and Letters</h2><p>First Edition Oxford University Press 1967, some wear, dj</p><p></p><h2>The Architect of Desire: Beauty and Danger in the Stanford White Family</h2><p>The story of Stanford White--his scandalous affair with the 16-year-old actress Evelyn Nesbit, his murder in 1906 by her husband, the millionaire Harry K. Thaw, and the hailstorm of publicity that surrounded "the trial of the century"--has proven irresistable to generations of novelists, historians, and biographers. The premier neoclassical architect of his day, White's legacy to the world were such masterpieces as New York's original Madison Square Garden, the Washington Square Arch, and the Players, Metropolitan, and Colony clubs. He was also responsible for the palaces of such clients as the Whitneys, Vanderbilts, and Pulitzers, the robber barons of the Gilded Age whose power and dominance shaped the nation in its heady ascent at the turn of the century.<br>As the century rolled on, however, the story of Stanford White and Evelyn Nesbit came to be viewed as glamorous and romantic, the darker narrative of White's out-of-control sexual compulsion obscured by time. Indeed, White's wife Bessie and his son Larry remained adamantly silent about the matter for the duration of their lives, a silence that reverberated through the next four generations of their extended family.<br>Suzannah Lessard is the eldest of Stanford White's great grandchildren. It was only in her 30's that she began to sense the parallels between the silence about her great-grandfather's life and the silence about her own perilous experience as a little girl in her own home. Thus she became drawn to the remarkable history of her family in order to uncover its hidden truths, and in so doing to liberate herself from its enclosure at last. The result is a multi-layered memoir of astonishing elegance and power, one that, like a great building, is illumined room by room, chapter by chapter, until the whole is clearly seen.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>In 1906, Suzannah Lessard's great-grandfather, the prominent architect, socialite, and hedonist Stanford White, was sensationally murdered by the husband of a showgirl White had seduced when she was 16. The acquittal of the killer on the grounds of insanity added to the scandalous gossip. In this beautifully written memoir, Lessard, a writer for the <i>New Yorker</i>, recalls growing up on the White family estate on Long Island, where the murder was a taboo subject. She evokes a sense of repressed and dark passion that infected the harmonious landscaping and architecture White had created. She writes of "coldness that may feel like warmth, or violence that presents as lust for life." In this extraordinarily literary nonfiction mystery, Lessard slowly reveals that her family history held more secrets than the murder, and reaches a startling and controversial climax.<b>Suzannah Lessard</b> was a staff writer at&nbsp;<i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i> for twenty years,&nbsp;and her work has also appeared in <i>The New York Times Magazine</i>, <i>Harvard Design</i> and <i>The Washington Monthly</i>, of which she is a founding editor.

Populist politicians exploit nationalism for authoritarian, chauvinistic, racist, and xenophobic purposes, reinforcing the view that it is fundamentally reactionary and antidemocratic. But Yael (Yuli) Tamir makes a passionate argument for a very different kind of nationalism&#x2015;one that revives its participatory, creative, and egalitarian virtues, answers many of the problems caused by neoliberalism and hyperglobalism, and is essential to democracy at its best. In <i>Why Nationalism</i>, she explains why it is more important than ever for the Left to recognize these qualities of nationalism, to reclaim it from right-wing extremists, and to redirect its power to progressive ends.</p><p>Far from being an evil force, nationalism&#x2019;s power lies in its ability to empower individuals and answer basic human needs. Using it to reproduce cross-class coalitions will ensure that all citizens share essential cultural, political, and economic goods. Shifting emphasis from the global to the national and putting one&#x2019;s nation first is not a way of advocating national supremacy but of redistributing responsibilities and sharing benefits in a more democratic and just way. In making the case for a liberal and democratic nationalism, Tamir also provides a compelling original account of the ways in which neoliberalism and hyperglobalism have allowed today&#x2019;s Right to co-opt nationalism for its own purposes.</p><p>Provocative and hopeful, <i>Why Nationalism</i> is a timely and essential rethinking of a defining feature of our politics.</p></p><p><b>Yael (Yuli) Tamir</b> is president of Shenkar College of Engineering and Design and adjunct professor at the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.

She is the author of <i>Liberal Nationalism</i> (Princeton). She lives in Tel Aviv."Interesting and provocative. . . . Highly ambitious."<b>---Jonathan Derbyshire, <i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>"Tamir&#x2019;s work makes an important contribution by forcing us to recognize that national feeling, however defined, isn&#x2019;t going away. Her argument is that the resurgence in nationalism derives in part from a reaction against an economic structure whose benefits flow mostly to those at the top, those who have rejected any responsibility for helping their fellow members of the national community. That is an argument progressives can and should incorporate into their presentation. But we can&#x2019;t do that if we reject the very idea of a national community, what Tamir defines as the &#x2018;political we.&#x2019;"<b>---Ian Reifowitz, <i>Daily Kos</i></b><br><br>"Progressives are getting nostalgic for nationalism. . . . <i>Why Nationalism</i> is an important contribution to this growing literature. Yael Tamir elegantly recounts nationalism&#x2019;s virtues."<b>---Peter Spiro, <i>Lawfare</i></b><br><br>"[Tamir] courageously defends moderate and universal nationalist outlooks, masterfully distinguishes between these and the murky populist wave washing over societies worldwide and endangering the Western democratic order . . . . [<i>Why Nationalism</i>] is outstanding in that it combines her background as a political philosopher with her many years of hands-on political experience, something that can&#x2019;t be said of many scholars in the West who are now focusing on these issues."<b>---Shlomo Avineri, <i>Haaretz</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[Tamir] pits nationalism against globalism and finds the former preferable.... Not a defense of Trumpian politics but a measured explanation of why the American populace was so receptive to both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders.&#x201d;<i><b>&#x2015;Kirkus </b></i><br><br>&#x201c;A book for our times, <i>Why Nationalism</i> is carefully argued and fiercely written. Yael Tamir provides an original and incisive account of the &#x2018;nationalism of the vulnerable&#x2019;&#x2015;the people who are being left behind&#x2015;expressing a sympathy that is often missing among liberal writers.&#x201d;<b>&#x2015;Michael Walzer, author of <i>A Foreign Policy for the Left</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;With clarity and insight, <i>Why Nationalism</i> describes the challenges posed by the recent turn to populist nationalism in Western liberal democracies. Yael Tamir brings a better and more thoughtful understanding of nationalism to bear on this hot topic than most other contributors.

It is no longer just a theoretical shift: every one of us will be touched by it, and many of us already have been. The meaning of disease, our understanding of the human body, and crucial decisions about what we all need to know and what choices we make about our health are at stake. Welcome to the new world of personalized medicine.</p><p>Twenty-one million Americans are affected by 6,000 so-called rare and orphan diseases, many of which are primarily attributable to misspelled genes. And virtually all diseases have a significant hereditary component. There have been many stories in the media about women who are testing to see if they have a mutation that leads to breast cancer, or family members who are strongly at risk for heart disease or Huntington's disease. Yet the revolution is much more fundamental than this: diabetes, heart disease, the common cancers, mental illness, asthma, arthritis, Alzheimer's disease, and more&#x2014;all of these diseases are having their secrets unlocked. Now, with a simple home test, costing a few hundred dollars, you can learn the secrets of your own DNA.</p><p>Francis Collins has been at the forefront of this revolution. He was, for fifteen years, the head of the international Human Genome Project, and he now serves as the Director of the National Institutes of Health. He knows, better than anyone, how widespread are the misperceptions about human genetics. Just in the past decade, most of what you think you know about DNA has been overturned. Much of the advice given routinely by health care providers is ill informed, so you need to educate yourself about this rapidly moving area of medicine. You are guaranteed to face some surprises, and some difficult choices about personal knowledge, treatment, and family risk.</p><p>Yet this book is overwhelmingly hopeful and inspiring, offering helpful advice in every chapter. Nearly every day, diseases that were barely understood, or completely misunderstood, are being redefined. Families that faced common problems, without hope, are now discovering a new world of understanding, treatment, and prevention. You owe it to yourself to learn about your DNA: how it works, what it reveals, and the benefits and limits of this new knowledge.</p><p>Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D., is a pioneer gene hunter. He spent fifteen years as director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, where he led the international Human Genome Project to a successful completion. For his revolutionary contributions to genetic research he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2007, and the National Medal of Science in 2009.

It examines the underworld secrets, the hidden regions of the American dream racket and the despair of a man driven into his own shadow by fame. There is also material on Sinatra, Monroe, Jerry Lewis, and the Hollywood / White House connection. By the author of &#34;Hellfire&#34;, a biography of Jerry Lee Lewis.</p><p>Only a handful of showbiz biographers can lay claim to posessing the literary acumen of writers like Michael Holroyd and Peter Ackroyd. Nick Tosches is one of these writers, and his unauthorized biography of Dean Martin stands as a testament to his genius. Several inimitable sequences in which Tosches adopts his subject's perspective (most of which are regrettably unsuitable for quotation here) make the book a real standout.<p> <i>Dino</i> is a fascinating portrait of a man who had it all--money, fame, women--and didn't give a damn about any of it and suggests that, even as he wallowed in the excesses of Hollywood and the Rat Pack, Martin stayed critically aloof from that world, albeit often in a booze-and-pill-addled haze. He got into showbiz precisely because it required so little effort of him: "I can't stand an actor or actress who tells me acting is hard work," he once said. "It's easy work. Anyone who says it is hard never had to stand on his feet all day dealing blackjack." Nobody could impress Martin. While Frank Sinatra would do anything just to hang out with reputed Mafioso, the Mob would have to make special trips to ask Martin in person to play a show at one of their casinos. </p><p> Tosches' portrait, written only a few years before Martin's death in 1996, depicts its subject as nothing so much as a Zen master without the spiritual anchor; after sampling everything that life had to offer and finding it lacking, Martin spent the last years of his life waiting to die in virtual seclusion.</p>From dealing blackjack in the small-time gangster town of Steubenville, Ohio, to carousing with the famous "Rat Pack" in a Hollywood he called home, Dean Martin lived in a grandstand, guttering life of booze, broads, and big money. He rubbed shoulders with the mob, the Kennedys, and Hollywood's biggest stars. He was one of America's favorite entertainers. But no one really knew him. Now Nick Tosches reveals the man behind the image--the dark side of the American dream. It's a wild, illuminating, sometimes shocking tale of sex, ambition, heartaches--and a life lived hard, fast, and without apologies.<p></p><p>"One-hundred-proof prose at its most scorching!" -- <i>Kirkus Reviews</i> </p><p></p><p>"More than a biography; it's a tour de force...Keep[s] readers glues to the pages." -- <i>West Coast Review Of Books</i></p></p><h2>I, Vampire Vol. 1: Tainted Love (The New 52)</h2><p>A <i>New York Times</i> Best Seller!<br><br>As a part of the DC Comics - The New 52 event of September 2011, I, Vampire is reborn in this new ongoing series!<p>For hundreds of years, vampire Andrew Stanton kept mankind safe from the horrors of the supernatural world, thanks to a truce he made with his ex-lover Mary, the Queen of the Damned.

In 1986, it was the site of both dazzling triumph and great loss as twenty-seven men and women reached the top but thirteen died trying. To this day it remains the single greatest tragedy in the history of mountaineering. Curran was there to record it all in words and photographs: courage and obsession, luminous success and thwarted ambition.</p><p>Before the 1996 Everest disaster made that mountain synonymous with tragedy at 8,000 meters, there was K2. More technical in most routes than Everest, the world&#39;s second-highest peak is considered the ultimate achievement by many mountaineers. In 1986 K2 claimed the lives of 13 climbers in nine different parties attempting its summit. Author Jim Curran was on the mountain during the ordeal, and through narrative and photographs, Curran documents the sagas of success, failure, and tragedy in a fateful year that captured the world&#39;s attention. Alongside the terror of avalanches, crevasses, and horrific storms are stories of bravery and the indomitable human spirit.Jim Curran, a climber and photographer, has recorded expeditions in South America, India, China, and the Karakoram Range. He lives in Sheffield, England.</p><h2>Mary Pope Osborne&#39;s Tales from the Odyssey The One-Eyed Giant (Tales from the Odyssey, 1)</h2><p>In these books based on episodes from Homer&#39;s Odyssey, Mary Pope Osborne brings to life the exciting adventures of one of the greatest heroes of all time. Now in paperback!</p><p>Mary Pope Osborne is the author of the best-selling series The Magic Tree House. She has also written many acclaimed retellings of myths and folktales and works of historical fiction.For graduates of D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Myths, these installments of the Tales from the Odyssey series deftly distill episodes from Homer's epic. Osborne (the Magic Tree House series) opens the first volume as Odysseus receives King Agamemnon's orders to join the fight against Troy, and bring home the Greek queen, Helen, kidnapped by a Trojan prince. In succinct chapters, the author then traces the labyrinthine journey of Odysseus and his men as they attempt to sail home to Ithaca. She touches on their encounters with the island of the lotus-eaters, Polyphemus the Cyclops and Aeolus, god of the winds. The second book brings the hero and his band to the island of the cannibal giants who devour a number of Odysseus's men, the palace of Circe the enchantress, who transforms some of the Greeks into swine, and the Land of the Dead, where Odysseus encounters his mother's ghost. Plot takes precedence over character development, but the hero's bravery and fidelity come through in his actions. In brief chapters and concise sentences, Osborne pares down each of these adventures into easily absorbed, swiftly paced episodes that will keep readers anxiously anticipating book three, Mermaids and Monsters, scheduled for spring 2003. Each volume includes a glossary of gods and goddesses and a pronunciation guide to the characters' names, which also help recommend this series as a tidy introduction to Homer and to Greek mythology.

It contains sketches of orange growers, orange botanists, orange pickers, orange packers, early settlers on Florida's Indian River, the first orange barons, modern concentrate makers, and a fascinating profile of Ben Hill Griffin of Frostproof, Florida who may be the last of the individual orange barons. McPhee's astonishing book has an almost narrative progression, is immensely readable, and is frequently amusing. Louis XIV hung tapestries of oranges in the halls of Versailles, because oranges and orange trees were the symbols of his nature and his reign. This book, in a sense, is a tapestry of oranges, too&#x2015;with elements in it that range from the great orangeries of European monarchs to a custom of people in the modern Caribbean who split oranges and clean floors with them, one half in each hand.</p></p><p>While many readers are familiar with John McPhee's masterful pieces on a large scale (the geological history of North America, or the nature of Alaska), McPhee is equally remarkable when he considers the seemingly inconsequential. <i>Oranges</i> was conceived as a short magazine piece, but thanks to his unparalleled investigative skills, became a slim, fact-filled book. As McPhee chronicles orange farmers struggling with frost and horticulturists' new breeds of citrus, oranges come to seem a microcosm of man's relationship with nature. <p> Like Flemish miniaturists who reveal the essence of humankind within the confines of a tiny frame, McPhee once again demonstrates that the smallest topic is replete with history, significance, and consequence.</p><p><b>John McPhee</b> was born in Princeton, New Jersey, and was educated at Princeton University and Cambridge University. His writing career began at <i>Time </i>magazine and led to his long association with <i>The New Yorker</i>, where he has been a staff writer since 1965.

When Andy went to Hollywood to film a TV pilot about a small-town sheriff, Don called to ask if the sheriff could use a deputy. The comedic synergy between Sheriff Andy Taylor and Deputy Barney Fife ignited <i>The Andy</i> <i>Griffith Show, </i>elevating a folksy sitcom into a timeless study of human friendship, as potent off the screen as on. Andy and Don&#x2014;fellow Southerners born into poverty and raised among scofflaws, bullies, and drunks&#x2014;captured the hearts of Americans across the country as they rocked lazily on the front porch, meditating about the simple pleasure of a bottle of pop.<br> <br>But behind this sleepy, small-town charm, de Vis�&#x2019;s exclusive reporting reveals explosions of violent temper, bouts of crippling neurosis, and all-too-human struggles with the temptations of fame. <i>Andy and Don </i>chronicles unspoken rivalries, passionate affairs, unrequited loves, and friendships lost and regained. Although Andy and Don ended their Mayberry partnership in 1965, they remained best friends for the next half-century, with Andy visiting Don at his death bed.<br> <br>Written by Don Knotts&#x2019;s brother-in-law and featuring extensive unpublished interviews with those closest to both men, <i>Andy and Don</i> is the definitive literary work on the legacy of <i>The Andy Griffith Show</i> and a provocative and an entertaining read about two of America&#x2019;s most enduring stars.</p><p>Daniel de Vis� is an author and journalist who has worked at <i>The</i> <i>Washington</i> <i>Post</i>, <i>The</i> <i>Miami Herald,</i> and three other newspapers in a twenty-four-year career.

William Jesse Knotts, Don&#x2019;s father, a man of average build and sky-blue eyes, made a living buying derelict farms, fixing them up, and selling them again. By the close of the 1910s, Jesse and his wife, Elsie, had settled on one farm long enough for Elsie to bear three children, all boys. Jesse raised crops and mined some coal he had found on the land. Theirs was not a prosperous life, but at least it was stable.<br> <br>One day, probably in 1919, Jesse collapsed in the fields. He was borne home by other men. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t see,&#x201d; he cried, although it seemed to others that he could. They called it hysterical blindness. Jesse lay in bed, sightless, for two weeks. His vision returned in time, but his mind did not. Jesse Knotts was said to have suffered a nervous breakdown, though more likely he was an undiagnosed schizophrenic. His physical health, too, fell into rapid decline, and soon he could no longer mind the family farm. Elsie, his wife, was left to tend the family fortunes.<br> <br>When Elsie lost the farm, she moved the family into town to occupy a succession of rental homes, sometimes sharing the space with various Knotts kin; Jesse&#x2019;s incapacity had brought the Depression to the Knotts household a decade early.<br> <br>Into this arrangement Jesse Donald Knotts was born on July 21, 1924. His first home seems to have been a boxy American Foursquare on Jefferson Street in Westover, just across the Monongahela River from central Morgantown. By 1929, the family had crossed the river and settled into a permanent dwelling: a large house on University Avenue, which Elsie rented from the Galusha family, owners of a corner grocery store. Elsie confined her family to the main floor; the upper rooms she rented to students, itinerants, and anyone else who could put a dollar down.<br> <br>Don was fourteen years younger than his next youngest sibling, William Earl, a boy so slender he was called Shadow. Don was an accident. Elsie, thirty-nine and married to a forty-two-year-old invalid, had not planned to bring another child into the world.<br> <br>Don&#x2019;s childhood was bleak, even by the sepia-toned standards of the Depression. The house on University Avenue sat in a crowded row of unkempt wooden colonials set against a steep hill. He slept on a cot in the kitchen, next to the stove. Two of his older brothers, Shadow and Sid, shared a bedroom with a boarder. Willis Vincent &#x201c;Bill&#x201d; Knotts, the most ambitious sibling, had already decamped to seek his fortune as a manager at Montgomery Ward. Don&#x2019;s mother and father slept in the living room, and Jesse Sr. spent most of his waking hours on the sofa, staring into space. Don&#x2019;s brothers liked to drink and fight; there was little to distinguish them from the vagabonds who paraded in and out of the University Avenue home.<br> <br>Don emerged from infancy with a ghostly pallor, a skeletal frame, and a predisposition to illness, traits he shared with his older brother Shadow. &#x201c;I did not come into the world with a great deal of promise,&#x201d; Don recalled. &#x201c;By the time I started grammar school, I was already stoop-shouldered, painfully thin, and forever throwing up due to a nervous stomach.&#x201d;<br> <br>Three decades later, Elsie Knotts would ask Don, &#x201c;Do you remember when you were in nappies, and your father used to hold a knife to your throat?&#x201d; Don did not. Only in therapy did the memories come flooding back. Don spent his first years living in fear of the monster on the couch. Jesse Knotts harbored a primal jealousy toward Don, the unexpected baby who drew Elsie&#x2019;s attention away from her bedridden husband. From the day Don arrived, he competed with his father for his mother&#x2019;s care.<br> <br>The only path out of Don&#x2019;s kitchen bedroom led through the living room, where his father lay. Don would try to tiptoe by. Sometimes he would pass unnoticed. Other times, the father would emerge from his fever dreams and train his bloodshot eyes on his youngest son. Don would freeze as he heard the ragged growl of an unpracticed voice: &#x201c;Come here, you little son of a bitch.&#x201d; Don would slowly retreat from the room. Usually, the summons was an empty threat. But on occasion, Jesse would rise from the couch like a shambling ghoul and stagger into the kitchen to find a blade. Then he would stumble through the house in search of his son; the hunt wouldn&#x2019;t take long, as there was nowhere for Don to go. Jesse would pin Don against the wall, raise the knife to his throat, and terrorize the child with dark oaths: &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll kill you, you son of a bitch.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jesse terrorized the rest of his family, as well. He was twice confined in the state mental hospital in Weston after threatening Elsie with a butcher knife. Those stays bought Don moments of relative peace in the family home.<br> <br>Over years of shrewd observation, Don learned to divine his father&#x2019;s moods, to read his face and voice. In this effort, Don developed a preternatural power to interpret body language and vocal tics. Perhaps Don&#x2019;s hypervigilance was a source of his comedic gifts: What was the Nervous Man, after all, if not an ensemble of twitches and quirks?<br> <br>Repulsed by his father, Don was drawn to his mother. Elsie Knotts was the angel to Jesse&#x2019;s foul-breathed demon, the sunlight to his darkness. Elsie was &#x201c;one of the truly good people of the world,&#x201d; Don recalled, &#x201c;more comfortable with the downtrodden than the high and mighty. Elsie found time to help any soul who needed her.&#x201d;<br> <br>Elsie was raised a born-again Christian. But as an adult, she hewed to her own code of right and wrong. She was, in a sense, the real-life Aunt Bee. Ever mindful of people&#x2019;s feelings, Elsie couldn&#x2019;t bear the thought of walking home from the A&amp;P past the window of the Galushas&#x2019; grocery store, lest the Galusha brothers should see her carrying groceries from another market. Instead, she and Don would detour around the block to the back of their house. Elsie also thought it improper for a Knotts boy to walk through the front door of the city jail. When Don&#x2019;s older brother Shadow was locked up on a drunk-and-disorderly charge, she packed a box of sandwiches and tobacco and instructed an Opie-aged Don, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want you going into that jail. I want you to go around to the back and yell up to the window there and get him to come to the window and throw this up to him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Though she embraced fundamentalist Christianity, Elsie also loved to play cards, and she collected autographs from the stars of screen and stage. &#x201c;My mother took me to movies from the very beginning,&#x201d; Don recalled. He and his mother probably saw Steamboat Willie, the first Disney film with synchronized sound, and Broadway Melody, the first talking musical, at Morgantown&#x2019;s Metropolitan Theatre. But nothing impressed Don quite like Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, the nation&#x2019;s premier comedy duo. Don was transfixed by their choreographed slapstick, just as he was mesmerized by Jack Benny&#x2019;s uncanny comic timing on the radio. Don loved the way those men could make his mother laugh. He dreamed that Elsie might ask for his own autograph one day.<br> <br>Elsie Knotts had a lovely, infectious, musical laugh, and everyone in the Knotts home wanted to hear it. Laughter brought escape from the pall that threatened to envelop them all. From an early age, Don set about finding the skills to summon that beautiful laugh. His principal instructor was his sickly brother.<br> <br>Shadow Knotts, born in 1910, had been the baby of the family for more than a decade when Don arrived; thereafter, it seemed as if Elsie Knotts had two youngest children, as their personalities developed along strikingly similar lines. Shadow suffered from asthma so severe that he slept sitting up. Yet, he filled the Knotts home with irrepressible wit. Don would follow Shadow around the house like a pint-size Ed McMahon, encouraging his cracks with peals of delighted laughter. Long before Don&#x2019;s birth, Shadow had fallen into the role of family jester. He was about ten when his father&#x2019;s mind broke, and he discovered, long before Don, that laughter could deliver his family from the darkness of dementia and poverty. Don once recounted the typical scene at the Knotts dinner table, where Shadow would labor to repel the chill that rose from his father, stony and silent at the head of the table.<br> <br>&#x201c;The clowning would begin with Shadow buttering his bread as if it were a violin, tucking it under his chin and using the butter knife for a bow,&#x201d; Don recalled, &#x201c;and it might continue with Shadow commenting to Sid under his breath, but loud enough for all to hear, that poor Tom Helfrick&#x201d;&#x2014;a beloved boarder who joined the family at the table&#x2014;&#x201c;had helped himself to two helpings of meat already. Sometimes the dinner hour would become complete mayhem, and I would laugh so hard I would have to leave the table, and the tears would run down the cheeks of my dear mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>Shadow seemed a natural comedian. He would walk past the university clock tower, look up to the man cleaning its face, and yell, &#x201c;Hey, buddy, you wouldn&#x2019;t happen to have the time?&#x201d; Once, while Elsie Knotts hosted a bridge party, Shadow walked into the bathroom, left the door ajar, and emptied an entire bucket of water into the toilet in a slow dribble, creating the impression of a ceaseless flow of urine. By the time he was done, the ladies at the bridge table were ashen.<br> <br>Shadow&#x2019;s humor endured even when he was bedridden, which was often. During one such spell, Don asked him what was wrong; Shadow replied, &#x201c;Everything I eat goes to my stomach.&#x201d;<br> <br>Whenever Shadow opened the door to leave the house, Don would beg him to stay. Once Shadow was gone, the family home would sink into despair. Don would escape the gloom &#x201c;by filling my space with imaginary characters with whom I would act out some happy drama. This was my first stage and, I suspect, the beginning of my acting career.&#x201d;<br> <br>Don&#x2019;s other brothers were a mixed bag. Bill, seventeen years older, was off working for Montgomery Ward by the time Don entered adolescence, moving from place to place with the retail chain. By the standards of the Knotts clan, Bill was a staggering success. He would send money home to help keep the family afloat, supplementing his mother&#x2019;s meager income from renting rooms and sewing and cooking for students. Nonetheless, Elsie Knotts was compelled to sell her beloved upright piano one month to pay the rent.<br> <br>Ralph &#x201c;Sid&#x201d; Knotts, the eldest brother, was another story. By the time of Don&#x2019;s birth, eighteen-year-old Sid had already run away from home, married, and fathered a child, who was discreetly dispatched to a grandmother on a family farm upon Sid&#x2019;s return. &#x201c;Sid was a real hick,&#x201d; recalled Richie Ferrara, Don&#x2019;s childhood friend. &#x201c;Sid was the decadence of West Virginia. He was a coal miner and he was an alcoholic, and he&#x2019;d go out and get drunk and come back and get mean. He&#x2019;d get mean to Don. Sometimes he would attack him, abuse him, hit him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Between odd jobs, Sid brewed moonshine to survive. Don wondered, later, whether drink had damaged Sid&#x2019;s brain. Sober, he was a gentle soul, joining brother Shadow in high jinks at the dinner table. Drunk, he was a bully. Once, Don stumbled upon Sid in the house, drinking home brew with friends. Don thought of their mother and scolded Sid, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t be down here like that.&#x201d; Sid raised the bottle and emptied it over Don&#x2019;s head. &#x201c;Now I&#x2019;m gonna tell Mama you&#x2019;ve been drinking,&#x201d; he slurred.<br> <br>Sid would crash into the house after a midnight binge, singing, &#x201c;Is it true what they say about Sidney?&#x201d; to the tune of &#x201c;Is It True What They Say about Dixie?&#x201d; Then he would storm into the kitchen to clatter around and fry eggs, waking Don on his cot. When Don would protest, Sid would slap him across the face, saying, &#x201c;Ha ha, get back down, you little brat.&#x201d;<br> <br>Between her sons&#x2019; escapades and those of her boarders, Elsie Knotts spent countless hours policing propriety in her home. &#x201c;I think my mother spent half her time chasing girls out of the rooms she rented to male students,&#x201d; Don recalled, &#x201c;to say nothing of my brothers&#x2019; tarts. More than once as a youngster did I see a half-naked woman dive out a bedroom window, and my mother charging through the front door, broom in hand, in an effort to head her off at the pass.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Depression brought hobos, as well, and a steady parade passed through the Knotts home. Some would try to jump the rent by lowering their suitcases from the window. But some of the male boarders would show a paternal interest in Don, who was essentially fatherless, taking him aside and teaching him small amusements. An itinerant guitarist showed Don how to play the ukulele. A carnival barker revealed how he fleeced his customers.<br> <br>Don spent many hours in his uncle&#x2019;s barbershop, a welcome escape from the perils of home. Uncle Lawrence, in some ways an antecedent to Mayberry&#x2019;s Floyd, would keep the customers laughing for hours with jokes and tall tales while Don sat and soaked it up. Lawrence would cut Don&#x2019;s hair for free, but only after the last paying customer had left.<br> <br>Don feared Sunday church just as he feared his father&#x2019;s daily schizophrenic ravings at home. Church was a weekly spectacle of fire and brimstone; overwrought parishioners would work themselves into a froth of faith, speak in tongues, fall to their knees, and roll in the aisles, sweating and twitching and weeping. Don would watch the congregation shake and shudder and babble, plainly enraptured by the Lord, and he would sit and wait for the wave of divinity to wash over him, and it never did. He feared he was doomed to hell.<br> <br>Finally, Don brought his fears to his mother. Elsie took him to see the preacher.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, son,&#x201d; the preacher said.<br> <br>&#x201c;But&#x2014;I&#x2019;m not feeling that thing that everyone&#x2019;s feeling,&#x201d; Don said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, son. You&#x2019;re saved.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jesse Knotts, Don&#x2019;s menacing father, died of pneumonia in spring 1937, at fifty-five. The family mourned; yet, after a time, it seemed to Don as if a bitter chill had lifted from the University Avenue house. His demon father exorcised, twelve-year-old Don began to come into his own, embarking upon that path of socialization and self-promotion that renders someone visible who has previously been invisible.<br> <br>With Shadow often too sick to jest, bit by bit the role of court jester in the Knotts household passed from him to Don. His first performances reprised scenes from Laurel and Hardy films or Abbott and Costello routines from the Kate Smith radio show. Don would play them for his mother while she baked bread. She would laugh in all the right places and offer rich dollops of praise when he was done. She was his first fan. Years later, when an interviewer asked why a scrawny kid such as him thought he could make it in New York, Don replied, &#x201c;Because my mother said I could.&#x201d;<br> <br>It occurred to Don that magic might be his way into show business. Whenever he could gather ten cents, he would send away for a magic trick from Johnson Smith &amp; Company, a mail-order house that advertised on the backs of comic books. He would approach his brothers at the card table with his new tricks, only to be shooed away when Shadow would crack, &#x201c;How about doing that disappearing trick?&#x201d;<br> <br>Around the start of junior high school, Don glimpsed a Johnson Smith ad that beckoned, &#x201c;Send ten cents and get your Ventrilo.&#x201d; Don was thrilled: He never missed Edgar Bergen&#x2019;s radio show. Sadly, Don opened th...</p><h2>Food In England</h2><p>First published in 1954 and the bible of English cooks ever since, Dorothy Hartley&#39;s FOOD IN ENGLAND is now back in print after many years. Her love of the infinite variety of English cooking and her knowledge of British culture and history show why our food should never be considered dull or limited. There are unusual dishes such as the Cornish Onion and Apple Pie, and even recipes for fungi, from common field mushrooms to puffballs. She describes some delicious puddings, cakes and breads, including an exotic violet flower ice cream, an eighteenth century coconut bread and Yorkshire teacakes. The finely-executed line drawings that accompany many of the recipes are more than just beautiful; they inform the cook about different varieties and techniques of food-handling. FOOD IN ENGLAND, which had such a deep influence on many contemporary cooks and food writers, will undoubtedly attract a new generation of admirers.</p><p>Dorothy Hartley wrote numerous books on British culture and history, including the six volumes of Life and Work of the People of England. FOOD IN ENGLAND is now regarded as a classic of its kind, with a deep influence on many contemporary cooks and food writers.&#39;A classic book without any worthy successor - a must for any keen English cook&#39; - DELIA SMITH &#39;Dorothy Hartley&#39;s ingenious ideas were one of my first inspirations; they show that English food should never be dismissed as boring&#39; - JOSCELINE DIMBLEBY &#39;This is the best of all books on English food. First published in 1954, it has popped up in print at intervals ever since, always welcome, always finding new admirers. Dorothy Hartley described Food In England as being like &#34;an old-fashioned kitchen, not impressive, but a warm and friendly place, where one can come in at any time and have a chat with the cook&#34;. So it is; and like a good old-fashioned kitchen it&#39;s intensely personal and full of bits and pieces at first sight not directly related to the production of food but somehow essential to the character of the place. Writing when she did, Dorothy Hartley was perhaps one of the last food historians to have easy access to the living past and her book views the preceding thousand years of food in England as a continuous present, all the cooks of the past wandering in and out of her kitchen. Full of traditional recipes, historical information, regional kitchen lore, personal reminiscences, household hints, gardening tips and brewing instructions, illuminating quotations and beautifully illustrated with expressive line drawings, Food In England is unsummarisable, copious and generous. Just buy it. Nobody with any interest whatsoever in English (and Scottish and Welsh) food, or who has any concern in what might make Britain British, should be without it.&#39; - Robin Davidson, AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEW</p><h2>Hana-Kimi, Vol. 16</h2><p>Japanese-American track-and-field star Mizuki is transferring to a high school in Japan, but not just any high school!

The Rector of Justin, originally published in 1964, is widely considered to be his most ambitious novel and his greatest achievement. <br><br>The terrain is familiar, vintage Auchincloss, in its astute dissection of the social mores of the Northeast's privileged establishment. The story centers on a prestigious Episcopal school for boys and its commanding, charismatic founder, Frank Prescott, a man whose lifelong goal was to head such a school. With laser-sharp insight, Auchincloss portrays the evolution of this man and the sources of his virtues and failings, his successes, and his crises of faith. Seamlessly interweaving multiple points of view&#x2014;from an adoring teacher to that of a rebellious daughter&#x2014;Auchincloss captures the brilliant totality of a man. Through the personalities and memories of six intense observers, a psychologically complex social history of the eighty years of his life emerges.<br><br>This new edition contains an Afterword by the author.</p><p>"Louis Auchincloss is one of the best writers alive.

Herriot's understated narrative stars Gyp and Sweep, sheepdog brothers with an extraordinary love for each other. Their owners, Mr. and Mrs. Wilkins, sell Sweep to a farmer but keep Gyp becauseas they tell the authorhe has never once barked. A year later, the Wilkinses take Gyp to a sheepdog trial where Sweep is performing admirably. Gyp watches intently and, as his brother guides the last of his flock into the pen, the soundless dog barks a single woof, before running to join Sweep in lusty play as in their puppy days. And that, Herriot declares, was the only time Gyp felt it necessary to give voice. Although Barrett's humans are stiff and unexpressive, his full-color paintings of animals and of the unspoiled, serene English countryside are simply wonderful. 175,000 first printing; $50,000 ad/promo; first serial rights to Redbook; BOMC selection. <br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.Grade 1-3 The Yorkshire vet tells the story of two sheepdog puppies, Gyp and Sweep, born on Mr. Wilkin's farm. Sweep is taken by another family and turns out to be an excellent sheepdog. His brother remains at Mr. Wilkins and never barks. At the sheepdog trials Gyp sees Sweep and he "woofs" in recognitionthe only time in his life that Gyp ever barks. The pretty, softly colored realistic illustrations nicely convey the feeling of the English countryside and the character of the dogs. This low-key story is similar in format and mood to Herriot's Moses the Kitten (St. Martin's Pr, 1984) and will appeal more to adult Herriot fans than young listeners.

In this follow-up to his blockbuster biblical studies, world-renowned scholar Eisenman not only gives us a full examination of James&#x2019; relationship to the Dead Sea Scrolls, he also reveals the true history of Palestine in the first century and the real Jesus&#x2019; of that time. It&#x2019;s a work of intriguing speculative history, complete with a conspiracy theory as compelling as any thriller.<br></b>Eisenman begins with a question: Is there a New Testament Code?&#x2019;&#x201d; He proves that there is and exposes the deliberate revisions, falsifications, and historical trivializations introduced into New Testament writings. In so doing, he identifies the Scrolls as the literature of the Messianic Movement in Palestine and decodes&#x201d; many favorite sayings in the Gospels, including These are the signs that the Lord did in Cana of Galilee.&#x201d; Offering a point-by-point analysis of James&#x2019; relationship to the Dead Sea Scrolls, he illuminates such subjects as the Pella Flight,&#x201d; the wilderness camps, and Paul as an Herodian,&#x201d; and demonstrates how, once we have found the Historical James, we will find the Historical Jesus.<br>Every page presents fascinating new insights and revelations that will leave Eisenman&#x2019;s many fans enraptured. And because it will coincide with the release of the similarly themed film of <i>The Da Vinci Code</i>, interest will be high.&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Robert Eisenman is the author of The New Testament Code: The Cup of the Lord, the Damascus Covenant, and the Blood of Christ, James the Brother of Jesus: The Key to Unlocking the Secrets of Early Christianity and the Dead Sea Scrolls (1998), The Dead Sea Scrolls and the First Christians (1996), Islamic Law in Palestine and Israel: A History of the Survival of Tanzimat and Shariah (1978), and co-editor of The Facsimile Edition of the Dead Sea Scrolls (1989) and The Dead Sea Scrolls Uncovered (1992). He is Emeritus Professor of Middle East Religions and Archaeology and the former Director of the Institute for the Study of Judeo-Christian Origins at California State University Long Beach and Visiting Senior Member of Linacre College, Oxford. He holds a B.A. from Cornell University in Philosophy and Engineering Physics (1958), an M.A. from New York University in Near Eastern Studies (1966), and a Ph.D from Columbia University in Middle East Languages and Cultures and Islamic Law (1971). He was a Senior Fellow at the Oxford Centre for Postgraduate Hebrew Studies and an American Endowment for the Humanities Fellow-in-Residence at the Albright Institute of Archaeological Research in Jerusalem, where the Dead Sea Scrolls were first examined. In 1991-92, he was the Consultant to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California on its decision to open its archives and allow free access for all scholars to the previously unpublished Scrolls. In 2002, he was the first to publicly announce that the so-called &#39;James Ossuary&#39;, which so suddenly and &#39;miraculously&#39; appeared, was fraudulent; and he did this on the very same day it was made public on the basis of the actual inscription itself and what it said without any &#39;scientific&#39; or &#39;pseudo-scientific&#39; aids.Eisenman, a Dead Sea Scrolls scholar and an expert in first-century Christianity, theorized in his book <i>James the Brother of Jesus</i> (1997) that the Qumran community, assumed to be responsible for the original Dead Sea writings, was important in the development of early Christianity. He further advances that theory here, once again using literary analysis of pertinent texts. Eisenman examines such topics as James' relationship to the Qumran community's Teacher of Righteousness and offers a reinterpretation of the Dead Sea Scrolls, especially the relatively recent translation of the MMT document, which he links to a Jamesian proto-Christianity. There is also much here about the Messianic movement in the first century and, more personally, about Peter and Paul's relationship to James and to one another. As in the previous book, however, Eisenman's writing is dense and often difficult to follow without a solid knowledge of the subject. Readers wishing to delve more closely into his sources will have to check the notes online. Moreover, he also uses some of the hefty work's 1,120 pages to settle some internecine scholarly feuds. As always, Eisenman's ideas are provocative, but it will take dedicated readers to digest them. <i>Ilene Cooper</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

He has been styled "the Patriarch of the West," a title which there are many reasons for ascribing to him. Not only was he the first to establish a perpetual monastic order in Western Christendom; but his Rule is the monastic norm of the first thousand years of the Church, and gave foundational shape to the whole of Western Christianity. </p><p> Newly published as a standalone volume, the Benedictine Essays of St. John Henry Newman was previously only available as part of the Historical Sketches appended to The Rise and Progress of Universities. Now for the first time ever, these two scholarly essays are brought together to highlight the powerful impact that St. Benedict and the Benedictine monastic way of life had in shaping the history of Western Civilization, expounded upon through the brilliant genius of the Catholic Church&#x2019;s most recently canonized saint: John Henry Cardinal Newman.</p><p>Benedictine monasticism has been poured out over the earth, rather than been sent, with a silent mysterious operation, while men slept, and through the romantic adventures of individuals, which are well nigh without record; and thus it has come down to us, not risen up among us, and is found rather than established. Its separate and scattered monasteries occupy the land, each in its place, with a majesty parallel, but superior, to that of old aristocratic houses.</p><p>This volume has been properly edited and formatted for modern readers (not merely photopied images of old print), complete with original footnotes, for use both in scholarly/academic settings, and also for personal enrichment. Newman&#x2019;s mastery of English language is in full force in this pair of essays dedicated to the history and spirit of Benedictine Monasticism and the original meaning of the idea of the &#x201c;Benedict Option&#x201d;.</p><p><b>About the Author </b></p><p>John Henry Newman (1801-1890) was an Anglican clergyman and leader of the Oxford Movement who eventually undertook the long and arduous journey that led to his conversion to the Roman Catholic Church.

Cardinal Newman is one of the preeminent masters of the English language, and his life and spiritual writings have led countless people into the Church.

Schwartz</b> was a professor at Georgia State University in Atlanta and the president of Creative Educational Services, Inc., a consulting firm specializing in leadership development.<p> <b>Chapter 1</b> </p><p> <b>Believe You Can Succeed and You Will</b> </p><p> Success means many wonderful, positive things. Success means personal prosperity: a fine home, vacations, travel, new things, financial security, giving your children maximum advantages. Success means winning admiration, leadership, being looked up to by people in your business and social life. Success means freedom: freedom from worries, fears, frustrations, and failure. Success means self-respect, continually finding more real happiness and satisfaction from life, being able to do more for those who depend on you. </p><p> Success means winning. </p><p> Success -- achievement -- is the goal of life! </p><p> Every human being wants success. Everybody wants the best this life can deliver. Nobody enjoys crawling, living in mediocrity. No one likes feeling second-class and feeling forced to go that way. </p><p> Some of the most practical success-building wisdom is found in that Biblical quotation stating that faith can move mountains. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can move a mountain and you can. Not many people believe that they can move mountains. So, as a result, not many people do. </p><p> On some occasion you've probably heard someone say something like, "It's nonsense to think you can make a mountain move away just by saying 'Mountain, move away.' It's simply impossible." </p><p> People who think this way have belief confused with wishful thinking. And true enough, you can't <i>wish</i> away a mountain. You can't <i>wish</i> yourself into an executive suite. Nor can you wish yourself into a five-bedroom, three-bath house or the high-income brackets. You can't wish yourself into a position of leadership. </p><p> But you <i>can</i> move a mountain with belief. You <i>can</i> win success by believing you can succeed. </p><p> There is nothing magical nor mystical about the power of belief. </p><p> Belief works this way. Belief, the "I'm-positive-I-can" attitude, generates the power, skill, and energy needed to do. When you believe I-can-do-it, the <i>how</i>-to-do-it develops. </p><p> Every day all over the nation young people start working in new jobs. Each of them "wishes" that someday he could enjoy the success that goes with reaching the top. But the majority of these young people simply don't have the belief that it takes to reach the top rungs. And they don't reach the top. Believing it's impossible to climb high, they do not discover the steps that lead to great heights. Their behavior remains that of the "average" person. </p><p> But a small number of these young people really believe they will succeed. They approach their work with the "I'm-going-to-the-top" attitude. And with substantial belief they reach the top. Believing they will succeed -- and that it's not impossible -- these folks study and observe the behavior of senior executives. They learn how successful people approach problems and make decisions. They observe the attitudes of successful people. </p><p> The how-to-do-it always comes to the person who believes he can do it. </p><p> A young woman I'm acquainted with decided two years ago that she was going to establish a sales agency to sell mobile homes. She was advised by many that she shouldn't -- and couldn't do it. </p><p> She had less than $3,000 in savings, and was advised the minimum capital investment required was many times that. </p><p> "Look how competitive it is," she was advised. "And besides, what practical experience have you had in selling mobile homes, let alone managing a business?" her advisors asked. </p><p> But this young lady had belief in herself and her ability to succeed. She quickly admitted she lacked capital, that the business was very competitive, and that she lacked experience. </p><p> "But," she said, "all the evidence I can gather shows that the mobile home industry is going to expand. On top of that, I've studied my competition. I know I can do a better job of merchandising trailers than anybody else in this town. I expect to make some mistakes, but I'm going to be on top in a hurry." </p><p> And she was. She had little trouble getting capital. Her absolutely unquestioned belief that she could succeed with this business won her the confidence of two investors. And armed with complete belief, she did the "impossible" -- she got a trailer manufacturer to advance her a limited inventory with no money down. </p><p> Last year she sold over $1,000,000 worth of trailers. </p><p> "Next year," she says, "I expect to gross over $2,000,000." </p><p> Belief, <i>strong belief,</i> triggers the mind to figuring ways and means and how-to. And believing you can succeed makes others place confidence in you. </p><p> Most people do not put much stock in belief. But some, the residents of Successfulville, USA, do! Just a few weeks ago a friend who is an official with a state highway department in a Midwestern state related a "mountain-moving" experience to me. </p><p> "Last month," my friend began, "our department sent notices to a number of engineering companies that we were authorized to retain some firm to design eight bridges as part of our highway building program. The bridges were to be built at a cost of $5,000,000. The engineering firm selected would get a 4 per cent commission, or $200,000, for its design work. </p><p> "I talked with 21 engineering firms about this. The four largest decided right away to submit proposals. The other 17 companies were small, having only 3 to 7 engineers each. The size of the project scared off 16 of these 17. They went over the project, shook their heads, and said in effect, 'It's too big for us. I wish I thought we could handle it, but it's no use even trying.' </p><p> "But one of these small firms, a company with only three engineers, studied the plans and said, 'We can do it. We'll submit a proposal.' They did, and they got the job." </p><p> Those who believe they can move mountains, do. Those who believe they can't, cannot. Belief triggers the power to do. </p><p> Actually, in these modem times belief is doing much bigger things than moving mountains. The most essential element -- in fact, <i>the</i> essential element -- in our space explorations today is belief that space can be mastered. Without firm, unwavering belief that man <i>can</i> travel in space, our scientists would not have the courage, interest, and enthusiasm to proceed. Belief that cancer can be cured will ultimately produce cures for cancer. Currently; there is some talk of building a tunnel under the English Channel to connect England with the Continent. Whether this tunnel is ever built depends on whether responsible people believe it can be built. </p><p> Belief in great results is the driving force, the power behind all great books, plays, scientific discoveries. Belief in success is behind every successful business, church, and political organization. Belief in success is the one basic, absolutely essential ingredient in successful people. </p><p> Believe, really believe, you can succeed and you will. </p><p> Over the years I've talked with many people who have failed in business ventures and in various careers. I've heard a lot of reasons and excuses for failure. Something especially significant unfolds as conversations with failures develop. In a casual sort of way the failure drops a remark like "To tell the truth, I didn't think it would work" or "I had my misgivings before I even started out" or "Actually, I wasn't too surprised that it didn't work out." </p><p> The "Okay-I'll-give-it-a-try-but-I-don't-think-it-will-work" attitude produces failures. </p><p> Disbelief is negative power. When the mind disbelieves or doubts, the mind attracts "reasons" to support the disbelief. Doubt, disbelief, the <i>subconscious will to fail,</i> the <i>not really wanting</i> to succeed, is responsible for most failures. </p><p> Think doubt and fail. </p><p> Think victory and succeed. </p><p> A young fiction writer talked with me recently about her writing ambitions. The name of one of the top writers in her field came up. </p><p> "Oh," she said, "Mr. X is a wonderful writer, but of course, I can't be nearly as successful as he is." </p><p> Her attitude disappointed me very much because I know the writer mentioned. He is not super-intelligent nor super-perceptive, nor super-anything else except super-confident. He believes he is among the best and so he acts and performs the best. </p><p> It is well to respect the leader. Learn from him. Observe him. Study him. But don't worship him. Believe you can surpass. Believe you can go beyond. Those who harbor the second-best attitude are invariably second-best doers. </p><p> Look at it this way. Belief is the thermostat that regulates what we accomplish in life. Study the fellow who is shuffling down there in mediocrity. He believes he is worth little, so he receives little. He believes he can't do big things, and he doesn't. He believes he is unimportant, so everything he does has an unimportant mark. As times goes by, lack of belief in himself shows through in the way the fellow talks, walks, acts. Unless he readjusts his thermostat forward, he shrinks, grows smaller and smaller in his own estimation. And, since others see in us what we see in ourselves, he grows smaller in the estimation of the people around him. </p><p> Now look across the way at the person who is advancing forward. He believes he is worth much, and he receives much. He believes he can handle big, difficult assignments -- and he does. Everything he does, the way he handles himself with people, his character, his thoughts, his viewpoints, all say, "Here is a professional. He is an important person." </p><p> A person is a product of his own thoughts. Believe Big. Adjust your thermostat forward. Launch your success offensive with honest, sincere belief that you can succeed. Believe big and grow big. </p><p> Several years ago after addressing a group of business men in Detroit, I talked with one of the gentlemen who approached me, introduced himself, and said, "I really enjoyed your talk. Can you spare a few minutes? I'd like very much to discuss a personal experience with you." </p><p> In a few minutes we were comfortably seated in a coffee shop, waiting for some refreshments. </p><p> "I have a personal experience," he began, "that ties in perfectly with what you said this evening about making your mind work for you instead of letting it work against you. I've never explained to anyone how I lifted myself out of the world of mediocrity; but I'd like to tell you about it." </p><p> "And I'd like to hear it," I said. </p><p> "Well, just five years ago I was plodding along, just another guy working in the tool-and-die trade. I made a decent living by average standards. But it was far from ideal. Our home was much too small and there was no money for those many things we wanted. My wife, bless her, didn't complain much, but it was written all over her that she was more resigned to her fate than she was happy. Inside I grew more and more dissatisfied. When I let myself see how I was failing my good wife and two children, I really hurt inside. </p><p> "But today things are really different," my friend continued. "Today we have a beautiful new home on a two-acre lot and a year-round cabin a couple hundred miles north of here. There's no more worry about whether we can send the kids to a good college and my wife no longer has to feel guilty every time she spends money for some new clothes. Next summer the whole family is flying to Europe to spend a month's holiday. We're really living." </p><p> "How did this all happen?" I asked. </p><p> "It all happened," he continued, "when to use the phrase you used tonight, 'I harnessed the power of belief.' Five years ago I learned about a job with a tool-and-die company here in Detroit. We were living in Cleveland at the time. I decided to look into it, hoping I could make a little more money. I got here early on Sunday evening, but the interview was not until Monday. </p><p> "After dinner I sat down in my hotel room and for some reason, I got really disgusted with myself. 'Why,' I asked myself, 'am I just a middle class failure? Why am I trying to get a job that represents such a small step forward?' </p><p> "I don't know to this day what prompted me to do it, but I took a sheet of hotel stationery and wrote down the names of five people I've known well for several years who had far surpassed me in earning power and job responsibility. Two were former neighbors who had moved away to fine subdivisions. Two others were fellows I had worked for, and the third was a brother-in-law. </p><p> "Next -- again I don't know what made me do this -- I asked myself what do my five friends have that I don't have, besides better jobs. I compared myself with them on intelligence, but I honestly couldn't see that they excelled in the brains department. Nor could I truthfully say they had me beat on education, integrity; or personal habits. </p><p> "Finally I got down to another success quality one hears a lot about. Initiative. Here I hated to admit it, but I had to. On this point my record showed I was far below that of my successful friends. </p><p> "It was now about 3:00 A.M., but my mind was astonishingly clear. I was seeing my weak point for the first time. I discovered that I had held back. I had always carried a little stick. I dug into myself deeper and deeper and found the reason I lacked initiative was because I didn't believe inside that I was worth very much. </p><p> "I sat there the rest of the night just reviewing how lack of faith in myself had dominated me ever since I could remember, how I had used my mind to work against myself. I found I had been preaching to myself why I couldn't get ahead instead of why I could. I had been selling myself short. I found this streak of self-depreciation showed through in everything I did. Then it dawned on me that no one else was going to believe in me until I believed in myself. </p><p> "Right then I decided, 'I'm through feeling second-class. From here on in I'm not going to sell myself short.' </p><p> "Next morning I still had that confidence. During the job interview I gave my new found confidence its first test. Before coming for the interview I'd hoped I would have courage to ask for $750 or maybe even $1000 more than my present job was paying. But now, after realizing I <i>was</i> a valuable man, I upped it to $3,500. And I got it. I sold myself because after that one long night of self-analysis I found things in myself that made me a lot more saleable. </p><p> "Within two years after I took that job I had established a reputation as the fellow who can get business. Then we went into a recession. This made me still more valuable because I was one of the best business-getters in the industry. The company was reorganized and I was given a substantial amount of stock plus a lot more pay." </p><p> Believe in yourself and good things <i>do</i> start happening. </p><p> Your mind is a "thought factory." It's a busy factory; producing countless thoughts in one day. </p><p> Production in your thought factory is under the charge of two foremen, one of whom we will call Mr. Triumph and the other Mr. Defeat. Mr. Triumph is in charge of manufacturing positive thoughts. He specializes in producing reasons why you can, why you're qualified, why you will. </p><p> The other foreman, Mr. Defeat, produces negative, depreciating tho...</p></p><h2>The Waves (Twentieth Century Classics)</h2><p>2013 Reprint of 1931 Edition. Full facsimile of the original edition, not reproduced with Optical Recognition Software. &#34;The Waves,&#34; first published in 1931, is Virginia Woolf&#39;s most experimental novel. It consists of soliloquies spoken by the book&#39;s six characters: Bernard, Susan, Rhoda, Neville, Jinny, and Louis. Also important is Percival, the seventh character, though readers never hear him speak through his own voice. The soliloquies that span the characters&#39; lives are broken up by nine brief third-person interludes detailing a coastal scene at varying stages in a day from sunrise to sunset. As the six characters or &#34;voices&#34; alternately speak, Woolf explores concepts of individuality, self, and community. Each character is distinct, yet together they compose a gestalt about a silent central consciousness. The novel follows its six narrators from childhood through adulthood. Woolf&#39;s novel is concerned with the individual consciousness and the ways in which multiple consciousnesses can weave together. The difficulty of assigning genre to this novel is complicated by the fact that &#34;The Waves&#34; blurs distinctions between prose and poetry, allowing the novel to flow between six not dissimilar interior monologues. The book similarly breaks down boundaries between people, and Woolf herself wrote in her Diary that the six were not meant to be separate &#34;characters&#34; at all, but rather facets of consciousness illuminating a sense of continuity.</p><p>This edition will be the most extensive and authoritative, the most fully collated, scrupulously researched and explicated text available to scholars to date, and for considerable time to come. Based on the first edition of Woolf&#39;s most challenging novel, this volume is an essential purchase for libraries and scholars."Clear, bright, burnished, at once marvelously accurate and subtly connotative. The pure, delicate sensibility found in this language and the moods it expresses are a true kind of poetry." "The New York Times <br>""The Waves" is often regarded as Virginia Woolf's masterpiece, standing with those few works of twentieth-century literature that have created unique forms of their own. In deeply poetic prose, Woolf traces the lives of six people from infancy to deathas theyfleetingly unite around the unseen figure of a seventh, Percival. Allusive and mysterious, "The Waves" yields new treasures upon each reading. <br>Virginia Woolf (1882-1941), one of the major literary figures of the twentieth century, transformed the art of the novel. The author of numerous novels, collections of letters, journals, and short stories, she was an admired literary critic and a master of the essay form. <br>Mark Hussey, general editor of Harcourt's annotated Woolf series, is professor of English at Pace University in New York City and editor of the Woolf Studies Annual. <br>Molly Hite is professor of English at Cornell University. She is the author of" Ideas of Order in the Novels of Thomas Pynchon, The Other Side of the Story: Structures and Strategies of Contemporary Feminist Narrative," and two novels, "Class Porn "and "Breach of Immunity." She has written articles on postmodernist and modernist fiction, feminist theory and practice, and academic culture. <br>"</p><h2>Isambard Kingdom Brunel</h2><p>Engineering genius, technical innovator and one of the greatest figures of the Industrial Revolution, Isambard Kingdom Brunel changed the face of the English landscape with his groundbreaking designs and ingenious constructions.

Consulting medical papers, surfacing the Web, and networking with other parents, they traced the onset of their child's problems to an immune system breakdown that coincided with his vaccinations. As a result, his digestive system was unable to break down certain proteins, which in turn led to abnormal brain development. So Karyn and her husband got to work -- Karyn implementing their program at home while her husband tested his theories at the scientific lab where he worked.<br><br><i>Unraveling the Mystery of Autism and Pervasive Developmental Disorder </i> is an inspiring and suspenseful chronicle of how one couple empowered themselves to challenge the medical establishment that promised no hope -- and found a cure for their child. <br><br>Here are the explanations and treatments they so carefully researched and discovered, a wealth of crucial tools and hands-on information that can help other parents reverse the effects of autism and PDD, including step-by-step instructions for the removal of dairy and gluten from the diet, special recipes, and an explanation of the roles of the key players in autism research.</p><p><b>Karyn Seroussi</b>, a freelance writer, is the cofounder of the Autism Network for Dietary Intervention (ANDI) and coeditor of ANDI News, a quarterly publication for parents of children with autism using biological intervention.Chapter One<br><br>The Diagnosis<br><br>A severe language delay is almost never diagnosed in a child under two, and autism is tricky--sometimes there are a few words and normal developmental milestones in the beginning and it's hard to notice when they disappear or don't increase. Besides, so many well-meaning people had reassured me:<br><br>You can't compare him to Laura--she was so precocious. Boys talk later than girls do. He's had so many ear infections. Alan didn't talk until he was three. My next-door neighbor's son didn't talk until he was four. Einstein didn't talk until he was . . .<br><br>I had changed pediatricians twice, begging for help or information regarding Miles's irregular sleep patterns and chronic ear infections. At that time, when he was a year old, his social development was not yet a problem, but his ears were. The first two doctors had concurred in a misdiagnosis of asthma due to his mucusy breathing, and prescribed albuterol, a medication that opens bronchial tubes, in the words of the first doctor, "to use if the noise bothers you."<br><br>"My mother just read an article linking milk and wheat to ear infections," I had explained to the second doctor. "Do you think I should try taking him off those foods?"<br><br>"The medical community doesn't put much stock in those studies," she had said. "You can try it if you like."<br><br>"Well, Miles loves milk. I'd hate to take it away if I don't have to."<br><br>"It probably won't make a difference anyway. Some kids just get ear infections. They'll clear up in the spring."<br><br>I had doubted that the ear infections would "clear up" by themselves. Alan and I had had the same disconcerting feeling that we would never again sleep through the night.<br><br>After eight ear infections in three months, and countless doses of antibiotics, I had asked the doctor if she would recommend ear tubes for Miles.<br><br>"I don't like medicating him so often," I had explained. "It seems like he's always on antibiotics. And he's up for so much of the night. I am really not functioning very well on so little sleep, and Laura is finding his constant crying extremely stressful."<br><br>"Well, some children require more effort than others. Just because you had an easy time with Laura doesn't mean there's something wrong with Miles."<br><br>"Yes, I realize that, but he is just so difficult. I own a retail business, and I can't tell you how many times I've had to leave work to bring him in. And the screaming . . . I'm sure there's something wrong with him. I thought that if he had ear tubes . . ."<br><br>The doctor had looked at me coldly.<br><br>"Parenting can sometimes interfere with our work schedules," she had said. "Perhaps you are the one who needs help, not Miles."<br><br>I was stunned. I had stared at her for a moment, then turned around and walked out of that office for the last time.<br><br>This event begins our story. I was to learn that the next chapter of our lives was not to be unique. To other parents of autistic children, it was a hauntingly familiar sequence of events.<br><br>Dr. Stover, our new pediatrician, was booked up when we switched to her practice, so on January 12 we saw her nurse-practitioner, Susan Percy.<br><br>"What about his breathing?" I asked. "We were told it was asthma, but the albuterol doesn't seem to make a difference. Can you hear it? It's not really wheezing. It's sort of a honking or clucking in the back of his throat."<br><br>Mrs. Percy listened for a moment. Then she went out and came back with Dr. Stover, who smiled and introduced herself. Miles picked up his shirt from the examining table and used it to play peekaboo with her while she put a stethoscope to his chest.<br><br>"Cute baby," she said, smiling. "Who told you that was asthma?"<br><br>"Two different doctors. What is it?"<br><br>"Just mucus," she said. "I don't know what causes that--allergies maybe--but don't worry about it. When he's old enough to clear his throat, it will go away. You can throw away the albuterol--it won't help."<br><br>"I didn't think it did," I said, smiling with relief.<br><br>In mid-February I was back in her office. I explained that I was concerned because Miles's language development seemed slower than Laura's had been.<br><br>"From what you've told me, Laura was an early talker," said Dr. Stover. "At this age, at thirteen months or so, two or three words is perfectly normal. Miles's social development looks good--I wouldn't worry. But I will send you over to Otolaryngology for a hearing test. I agree that he has had an awful lot of ear infections."<br><br>Two weeks later, on March 3, Miles did fairly well on the test. He showed only a very mild hearing loss--"within normal parameters."<br><br>We visited the office again a month later, on April 4, for Miles's fifteen-month "well-baby" visit.<br><br>"Miles's ears look good."<br><br>"Yes, well, they should. Alan says we should buy stock in amoxicillin. But one more ear infection and he's getting ear tubes--Dr. Roberts at Oto gave me his solemn promise."<br><br>Ear infections occur when fluid builds up in the inner ear. "Tubes," which are called "grommets" in England, are little rubber cylinders that are installed in the eardrum to help alleviate the pressure and hopefully prevent further infections. While the child is anesthetized, his doctor makes a tiny incision in the eardrum and inserts the tube as if it were a window between two rooms.<br><br>Mrs. Percy laughed and handed me a form to sign, authorizing them to give Miles his measles-mumps-rubella vaccine.<br><br>"What happens if I don't sign this?" I asked.<br><br>"Well, you won't be able to send Miles to nursery school, or kindergarten."<br><br>"Oh. Okay. It's just that these risk warnings are kind of scary."<br><br>"Well, vaccine reactions are very rare. Try not to think about it."<br><br>"Okay. But first, can you give him some Tylenol? He had a really bad screaming episode after his two-month DPT shot."<br><br>Three days later I was back. Miles had another ear infection.<br><br>Eight days after the shot, on April 12, after giving me another lecture about how the medical community was trying to be more conservative about inserting ear tubes, the otolaryngologist approved the surgery. It would be at the end of the month, just before our trip to Los Angeles to visit Alan's family.<br><br>Then, two days after that, Miles had a really miserable day. It was the first night of Passover, a night when my family always came together from different parts of the country. I was having the Seder, the ceremonial dinner, at my house, and was frantically trying to prepare. Fortunately, I had arranged for Lyn, our baby-sitter, to stay for dinner and to put the children to bed. Miles was pale and cranky, and barely acknowledged his grandmother or his adored Uncle Matthew. He cried during the meal and refused to eat, instead drinking several cups of milk. Lyn put him to bed early.<br><br>Late that night, only an hour after I finished cleaning the kitchen, Miles was up screaming. His face was red and his limbs seemed to be shaking. Alan put some liquid ibuprofen in a cup with a couple of ounces of milk, but no sooner did Miles drink it than he threw up. Over the screaming I hollered to Alan to find the thermometer--Miles was beginning to feel warm.<br><br>By the time Alan found the thermometer Miles was very, very hot. I measured his temperature at 106. His limbs were trembling violently, and his screams had intensified. I threw him into his car seat and drove the two miles to the hospital as fast as I could, running two red lights in the quiet streets.<br><br>Finally, after three Tylenol suppositories, Miles stopped crying and fell asleep. The resident at the emergency room did not have an explanation.<br><br>The next three weeks were strange ones. Miles seemed very spaced out. He stopped talking, stopped smiling, and started drinking a lot of milk.<br><br>Then, at exactly sixteen months old, Miles got his ear tubes. In the waiting room, before the surgery, he held my hand as we watched the tropical fish swim peacefully in a large tank. "Ishhhhh," he whispered, for the last time.<br><br>After the surgery the doctor told us he had had something called "glue ear."<br><br>"The fluid in his ear had hardened into a thick gum, like silly putty," he said. "It must have been causing a bit of discomfort and perhaps some mild hearing loss."<br><br>"What causes that? Could that be from allergies? My mother thinks ear infections are caused by milk allergy."<br><br>"I don't know about that. I do see this in some children. It's good that we got in there, since masses like that harbor infection and take a long time to go away by themselves. You're probably going to see a real explosion in his language now."<br><br>"Thank you so much," I said, relieved. "We're so glad to have this over with." Alan picked up his dazed son and carried him out to the car.<br><br>"Now maybe things will get back to normal," he said.<br><br>But things did not.<br><br>Soon we forgot what normal was.<br><br>My father-in-law was very ill, and we knew that it was the last time that our children would ever see him. I brought the video camera on our trip to California, and taped much of our visit. Laura was so cute, singing songs and telling stories in her squeaky little voice, golden ringlets bouncing around her head.<br><br>Meanwhile, in the background, Miles trotted back and forth across a patch of gravel in his grandparents' back yard. Back and forth, back and forth. Several times I tried to engage him, my voice on the videotape sounding cheerful but with an obvious note of concern.<br><br>"Hi, Miles! Hi, sweetie! Whatcha doing?"<br><br>Miles would turn and stare at the camera, unsmiling, for a few seconds, then turn away. There was no joy, no sadness, no curiosity, no connection, nothing. I moved the camera away from my face and tried again.<br><br>"Miles! Miles! Milo! Miles!"<br><br>He finally turned and looked at me as if I were a few lines of incomprehensible hieroglyphics, a meaningless combination of features. Chilled, I turned off the camera.<br><br>At the table that evening, in his high chair, I saw a faint glimmer of acknowledgment as he recognized a familiar command. "Milo, make, bang-bang! Make bang-bang!" I smacked both hands on the table to show him. He knew this; he had done this before. It was one of his favorite games. I felt a twinge of fear. Suddenly, he responded, just for a moment, patting the table with his hands. Then, abruptly, he looked away. I could not get him to do it again.<br><br>After our trip, life became much worse. Miles's stools had become very loose, with a sour, pungent smell, and he became more and more withdrawn.<br><br>One day I was trying to get lunch ready before Miles woke up. Please, just one more minute. He could read my mind. I heard a whine from the baby monitor on the kitchen windowsill. I had forgotten to make a bottle. Urgently, I rinsed off my hands and poured milk into a bottle, screwing on the nipple as I ran upstairs. Sometimes, if he got the bottle fast enough . . . but it was too late. The whines had turned to screams.<br><br>Every time he woke up, every morning and after every nap, Miles would cry inconsolably for about half an hour. Nothing seemed to help, and nothing distracted him. I could tell that Lyn, our babysitter, was close to quitting.<br><br>"Babies are not supposed to cry this much," she said, over the din, as if I had some control over the duration of his screaming.<br><br>I looked at her helplessly. Aren't some babies just high-strung?<br><br>"Miles, cut it out! Stop!" Alan once shouted. He so rarely raised his voice to the children; it actually startled Miles into stopping, for a moment. Then he began to scream again.<br><br>"Miles, Miles, you're giving me a migraine."<br><br>"Maybe he's got a migraine," I suggested. "Look at how he's rubbing his forehead on your chest." I took over for a while, holding him and making soothing noises, for my own comfort, I suppose, since it seemed to make little difference to the unhappy child in my arms.<br><br>Sometimes, after ten or fifteen minutes, we could get him to stop with a bottle of milk and a Disney sing-along video. I remember the feeling of relief when the moving images finally caught his attention and the screaming began to ease up. I would hold perfectly still with him in my arms, afraid to move. After a few minutes, my muscles would begin to ache, and I would ease him onto the couch, moving so slowly and noiselessly that even my cat wouldn't have noticed.<br><br>After a while, we found ourselves relying on those videos a lot.<br><br>"Hey, Alan, remember before we had kids, when we agreed that we disapproved of TV for young children?"<br><br>Alan just looked at me grimly.<br><br>We got into the habit of keeping cups of milk handy at all times, just to avoid the screaming. On ice, in our bedroom, for at least one nighttime awakening. Three cups in the diaper bag for a two-hour trip to the mall.<br><br>I was at my store. A frequent customer of mine, Patty, was there with her little boy. Her son was the same age as mine and was also not really talking, although he said a couple of words. I smiled at him. He smiled back. Patty prompted him.<br><br>"Jimmy, can you say hi to Karyn?" His grin widened. "He's started saying hi," she explained. Suddenly, he pointed at a poster behind me, which had a picture of a bird on it.<br><br>"Look!" he said excitedly.<br><br>At that very moment my mind became firmly unsettled. My belief that my children were safe and healthy was seriously threatened for the very first time since I had become a parent. At first I couldn't put my finger on it, but there was something about what Patty's son had just done that mine simply could not do. Then I realized that he had pointed.<br><br>Just what was it about pointing that was so special? I recognized that it was a child's request for shared attention, his way of saying "I want you to see what I'm seeing." Miles did not seem to care about things like that. When Laura was a toddler, I could hardly sit down before she filled my lap with items to share with me, or for me to appreciate with her. She had pointed regularly, while Miles did not. What I didn't realize at the time was that the absence of pointing is one of the defining characteristics of autism.</p><h2>Nicholas Sparks: The Complete Collection (19 book box set)</h2><p>BRAND NEW, Exactly same ISBN as listed, Please double check ISBN carefully before ordering.</p><p></p><h2>Master Disaster: Five Ways to Rescue Desperate Watercolors</h2><p><p><b>No more wimpy watercolors!

The only thing missing is Gary's gift for Rachel. On a last-minute Christmas Eve visit to Tiffany's, he quickly picks out a charm bracelet for her, and heads back to their hotel.

She lives with her husband and daughter in South Dublin.Chapter 1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>The significance of what he was about to do wasn&#x2019;t lost on Ethan Greene. It was a big moment in his life; it would be in any man&#x2019;s, he guessed.<br>But as he battled through the Manhattan crowds on possibly the busiest shopping day of the year, he wished that he&#x2019;d chosen a better time.<br>Christmas Eve on Fifth Avenue? He must be mad.<br>Taking a deep breath of the cold air, which was refreshing and not as damp as it usually was in London, he couldn&#x2019;t help but think how little had changed since the last time he was in this city and, at the same time, how much had.<br>Arriving in New York only two days earlier, he&#x2019;d surprised himself by how well he remembered the landmarks and how easily he found his way around. The jostle of the subway ride from midtown to downtown and back again, the scent of well-worn vinyl taxi seats and the endless hum of a billion sounds &#x2013; human or inanimate &#x2013; buoyed him. The unmistakable buzz of the place put a new spring in his step, something he hadn&#x2019;t felt in years.<br>But now Ethan was in a hurry and acutely aware that the minutes were ticking by and the crowds seemed to be growing thicker. There wasn&#x2019;t much time left.<br>Alongside him Daisy squeezed his hand briefly as if sensing what he was thinking, yet she couldn&#x2019;t possibly know what he&#x2019;d planned. All he&#x2019;d said was that he needed to make one more stop before they returned to the warmth of their hotel. Conscious of how much he hated crowds (and shopping for that matter) she was probably just trying to put him at ease.<br>How would she react? OK, so the idea had been on the cards for a while and had been mentioned more than once recently, so by rights today shouldn&#x2019;t really be too much of a surprise. While she seemed keen, Ethan now realised that he really should have spoken to her about today &#x2013; it was unlike him not to discuss such matters with her in more detail &#x2013; but the truth was that he was nervous. What if her reaction wasn&#x2019;t as positive as he&#x2019;d anticipated? As he wondered, an anxious lump appeared in his throat. Well, he&#x2019;d find out her reaction soon enough, especially when they reached their destination.<br>She looked especially pretty today, he thought, wrapped up in a multitude of layers to keep out the teeth-chattering cold, her blonde curls creeping out under a dark woollen hat, and her red nose appearing above a black embroidered scarf. Despite the cold, she was loving New York just as he&#x2019;d known she would, and everyone knew there was no better time than Christmas to visit the city that never sleeps. Yes, this was a good idea, Ethan reassured himself. Everything would work out fine.<br>Finally, having negotiated their way through the mass of last-minute shoppers, they reached the corner of Fifth Avenue and Fifty-Seventh Street. He looked at Daisy, and her eyes widened in surprise as he took her hand and steered them both towards the entrance.<br>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s going on?&#x2019; she squealed, glancing at the familiar nameplate beside the doorway, its typically clean-line wording on polished granite today surrounded by verdant pine branches especially for the Christmas season. &#x2018;What do we need <i>here</i>?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;I told you &#x2013; I need to pick something up,&#x2019; Ethan replied, leading the way and giving her a brief wink as the revolving glass doors deposited them in the hallowed halls of Tiffany &amp; Co.<br>Daisy was immediately captivated by the vast, high-ceilinged sales floor and its column-free design, and she gazed in amazement at the long rows of glass-fronted cases, their precious wares twinkling alluringly under the spotlights.<br>&#x2018;Oh wow, it&#x2019;s all so beautiful,&#x2019; she whispered in awe, standing in the middle of the aisle as crowds of equally spellbound shoppers and tourists milled around her, each one fascinated by the breathtaking jewellery displays. The store was one of the few in Manhattan that didn&#x2019;t utilise lavish festive decoration; its sparkling wares required little embellishment, and combined with the unmistakably romantic Tiffany&#x2019;s allure this was more than enough to create that magical Christmas feeling.<br>&#x2018;It is, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; Ethan agreed, his nervousness dissipating somewhat now they were here. He took her arm and guided her between the various display cases and down towards the elevators at the back, his tired feet temporarily soothed by the soft-carpeted floor.<br>&#x2018;Where are we going?&#x2019; she asked, moving forward reluctantly. &#x2018;Slow down a bit! Can&#x2019;t we take a look around? I&#x2019;ve never been here before and&nbsp;... Where are we going?&#x2019; she repeated, bemused, as the elevator doors opened.<br>&#x2018;The second floor, please,&#x2019; Ethan requested.<br>&#x2018;Certainly, sir.&#x2019; The besuited lift attendant complied, graciously bowing his top-hatted head. He smiled at Daisy. &#x2018;Madam.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;But&nbsp;... why would we be going there?&#x2019; she asked, her voice hushed, and he deduced she&#x2019;d read from the directory display overhead what was on this particular floor. She was certainly taken with the place, but however enthralled she&#x2019;d been downstairs, he knew she would really be impressed by the second floor.<br>Ethan&#x2019;s heart began to hammer in his chest as the elevator doors closed. Would she be OK with this? Again, he probably should have just come right out and asked, but he figured that she&#x2019;d enjoy the surprise, and he also thought it was important that she felt very much a part of it.<br>His voice was light. &#x2018;Like I said, I need to pick something up.&#x2019;<br>Now Daisy gazed open-mouthed at him. &#x2018;You&#x2019;re not...&#x2019; she gasped, immediately understanding, but from her expression Ethan still couldn&#x2019;t quite gauge her reaction, and he guessed the presence of the attendant was intimidating her into asking no further questions.<br>Within seconds, the elevator doors reopened and he and Daisy stepped out into the wood-panelled room on Tiffany&#x2019;s famed Diamond Floor, where he had come to collect his purchase.<br>&#x2018;I can&#x2019;t believe this!&#x2019; she was saying as they approached one of the hexagon-shaped wood-and-glass display cases, her head swivelling from left to right as she watched various happy couples around the room being served champagne while they made what would arguably be the most important purchase of their lives. &#x2018;I really can&#x2019;t believe it! <i>This</i> is what you&#x2019;re picking up?&#x2019;<br>Ethan smiled nervously. &#x2018;I know I should have said something but&#x2014;&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Ah, Mr Greene.&#x2019; An elderly and distinguished sales assistant addressed Ethan before either had a chance to say anything more. &#x2018;Pleasure seeing you again. Everything is in order and ready to go. We weren&#x2019;t sure, and I forgot to ask on the phone, if you preferred your purchase already gift-wrapped, or wanted to show the lady first...&#x2019; He smiled at Daisy, who beamed back at him, wide-eyed.<br>&#x2018;Oh yes, let me see, please!&#x2019; she exclaimed and then put a guilty hand to her mouth, conscious that she really should be showing a little more decorum &#x2013; especially in a place like this.<br>Ethan hid a smile.<br>&#x2018;Well, here we are,&#x2019; the older man said, his voice low and gentle as he presented them with the world-renowned little blue box. Placing it ceremoniously on the glass display in front of Daisy, he pulled back the lid to reveal the platinum marquise solitaire Ethan had chosen a couple of days before.<br>The ring had needed to be sized correctly, which was why he was picking it up today, and now considering it afresh he was pretty sure he&#x2019;d made a good choice. It was the classic Tiffany setting: the diamond lifted slightly above the band and held in place by six platinum prongs in order to maximise the stone&#x2019;s brilliance.<br>&#x2018;So what do you think?&#x2019; he asked Daisy, but it was pretty obvious that she was captivated by the beautiful ring, although that wasn&#x2019;t really the question Ethan was asking.<br>But when she turned to look at him, her delighted expression told him everything he needed to know.<br>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s the perfect choice, Daddy,&#x2019; Ethan&#x2019;s eight-year-old daughter assured him, &#x2018;and Vanessa is going to absolutely <i>love</i> it!&#x2019;<br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*<br>Thank goodness her reaction had been positive.<br>All day &#x2013; no, strike that, all <i>month</i> &#x2013; Ethan had worried about how Daisy would feel about this. Especially when this New York trip held a special significance for both of them.<br>Earlier that day, over a couple of hot chocolates in a midtown caf�, he had watched his daughter pick at an iced lemon cupcake, and known that something was on her mind. Just as her mother had always done, Daisy got that squinty look in her eyes and offset her jaw ever so slightly when deep in thought.<br>&#x2018;Did you like Times Square?&#x2019; he asked, fishing. &#x2018;With all the lights and everything?&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;Everything&#x2019;s just so beautiful,&#x2019; she replied and then paused, looking out of the window at the bustling street. &#x2018;Mum said Manhattan was like one big Christmas tree at this time of year. She was right.&#x2019;<br>&#x2018;You really remember how much your mother talked about it, don&#x2019;t you?&#x2019; he asked.<br>She gave a little smile. &#x2018;I know I was only small, but I loved hearing about it.&#x2019;<br>Ethan nodded. &#x2018;Of course, she was right about it being like a big Christmas tree. Your mum was right about lots of things.&#x2019;<br>Suddenly, the significance of sitting here with his daughter in the city that her mother had adored so much washed over Ethan and almost took his breath away. Swallowing hard, he tried to gather his thoughts.<br>&#x2018;You know what else she was right about?&#x2019; Ethan added, and Daisy looked intently at him as she always did whenever he had something about her mother to relate. It wasn&#x335;...</p><h2>Catholic Revivalism: The American Experience 1830-1900</h2><p>Jay P. Dolan's <i>Catholic Revivalism: The American Experience, 1830&#x2013;1900</i> details the history of the Catholic Church in America by showing that revivalism, traditionally viewed as a Protestant phenomenon, was also a central feature of Catholic life and activity in the 19th century. To cope with the widespread social disorganization caused by large numbers of Catholic immigrants, the Church sponsored parish missions during which famous preachers gave a series of emotional sermons aimed at calling sinners back to their God and their Church. Dolan documents the extent of Catholic revivalism, its European roots, and its success in reaching the working class.</p><p>Jay P. Dolan is a professor emeritus of history. He was a member of the faculty at the University of Notre Dame for thirty-three years, 1971&#x2013;2004. He also taught at the University of San Francisco, the University of Chicago, University College, Cork, Ireland, and Boston College.

His most recent work is, The Irish Americans: A History (2008).&#x201c;[T]his is a remarkable study, casting . . . light on the shape of Catholicism in 19th century America, illuminating from an unexpected angle discussions of the &#x2018;Americanization&#x2019; of Catholicism, and filling in the story of revivalism.&#x201d; (Christian Century)</p><h2>Remarkable Reindeer (Science Vocabulary Readers)</h2><p>Learn all about Reindeer</p><p></p><h2>The Last Intellectuals: American Culture in the Age of Academe</h2><p>Argues that there are no longer intellectuals working outside of the academic world, criticizes the New Left, and explains the decline of bohemia</p><p>Writers and thinkers like Edmund Wilson and Lewis Mumford reached a diverse public, but today's intellectuals cluster in universities, producing monographs and articles read by a select few. Jacoby's thesis is that nonacademic intellectuals capable of a dialogue with a general, educated audience are an endangered species, nearly extinct. He notes that many 1960s New Leftists on campus were absorbed into the university, where they have produced a body of radical, feminist and neo-Marxist scholarship, but he finds their work "largely technical, unreadable, and unread." Jacoby, whose books include Social Amnesia and The Repression of Psychoanalysis, links the decline of urban bohemian intellectuals to rising rents and living expenses. He suggests that rather than count the high proportion of Jews among the radical intelligentsia, we should take note of how few Jewish intellectuals have remained dissenters. His tract is bound to provoke heated debate. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.Where are the heirs of Edmund Wilson, Lewis Mumford, Jane Jacobs, C. Wright Mills, Alfred Kazin, the "public intellectuals" who have enriched American life in our century? Nowhere, says Jacoby, who finds that intellectuals of the postwar generation address a diminished audienceone another. His diagnosis traces this blight to the withering of urban bohemia, to the shrinkage of writing outlets, and above all to the suffocating growth of academic careerism. No matter that literature and social criticism are treated to the exclusion of science and the arts. Or that Jacoby is mainly concerned with intellectuals on the left. Vigorous, witty, controversial, this analysis of America's "aging intellectual plant" is a fine example of the very sort of book Jacoby fears has vanished.

Gordon Wasson.<br><br>A legendary figure in the field of ethnobotany, R. Gordon Wasson's trail-blazing work on hallucinogenic mushrooms with the Mexican curandera Maria Sabina in the 1950s brought increased scholarly attention to the importance of psychoactive plants in the spiritual life of indigenous peoples and had a profound influence well beyond the academic world. His accessible writings helped popularize these discoveries, forming the ground for the social revolution of the following decade. With the growing interest in the role of psychoactive plants in society today, the work of R. Gordon Wasson and the example set by the man himself, so well illustrated here, takes on increasing importance.</p><p>Wasson (1898-1986) was an amateur mycologist whose scholarly writings on hallucinogenic mushrooms pioneered the field of ethnomycology.

It is a story built of sheep horns, tussocks, gale winds, fishing huts, bone button holders, wolffish skin lampshades, young puffins, half-dried cod and one lovingly smoked corpse of a woman dead too long in a remote stretch of frozen landscape. It is folk tale and philosophy, a farmer's sensibilities and his favorite remembered poems. It is, most of all, elemental. While I know very little about sheep farming and have never traveled to Iceland&#x2014;many of the terms in this slender story are delicately foreign&#x2014;I never felt excluded, lost or forgotten. Birgisson is a generous, universal writer, and this is a love story.

Birgisson&#x2019;s long letter (but short novel) is a transcultural and evocative story about regret and choice, and, for the American audience, a thoughtful meander through the Icelandic countryside not often considered and now unforgettable." &#x2014;<i>Iowa Review</i></p></p><h2>Bring Me the Rhinoceros: And Other Zen Koans to Bring You Joy</h2><p><i>Bring Me the Rhinoceros</i> is an unusual guide to happiness and a can opener for your thinking. For fifteen hundred years, Zen koans have been passed down through generations of masters, usually in private encounters between teacher and student. This book deftly retells fourteen traditional koans, which are partly paradoxical questions dangerous to your beliefs and partly treasure boxes of ancient wisdom. Koans show that you don&#x2019;t have to impress people or change into an improved, more polished version of yourself. Instead you can find happiness by unbuilding, unmaking, throwing overboard, and generally subverting unhappiness. John Tarrant brings the heart of the koan tradition out into the open, reminding us that the old wisdom remains as vital as ever, a deep resource available to anyone in any place or time.<br><br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s a book to crack the happiness code if ever there was one. Forget about self-improvement, five-point plans, and inspirational seminars that you can&#x2019;t remember a word of a week later. Tarrant&#x2019;s is the fix that fixes nothing because there is nothing to fix. Your life is a koan, a deep question whose answer you are already living&#x2014;this is the true inspiration, and Tarrant delivers.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roger Housden, author of the <i>Ten Poems</i> series<br><br>&#x201c;Every life is full of koans, and yet you can&#x2019;t learn from a book how to understand them. You need someone to put you in the right frame of mind to see the puzzles and paradoxes of your experience. With intelligence, humor, and steady, deep reflection, John Tarrant does this as no one has done it before. This book could take you to a different and important level of experience.&#x201d;&#x2014;Thomas Moore, author of <i>Care of the Soul</i> and <i>Dark Nights of the Soul</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Bring Me the Rhinoceros</i> is one of the best books ever written about Zen. But it is more than that: it is a book of Zen, pointing us to reality by its own fluent and witty example. John Tarrant has the rare ability to enter the minds of the ancient Zen masters as they do their amazing pirouettes upon the void and, with a few vivid touches, to illuminate our lives with their sayings.&#x201d;&#x2014;Stephen Mitchell, author of <i>Gilgamesh: A New English Version</i><br><br>&#x201c;This book&#x2019;s straightforward honesty, clear writing, and destabilizing insight have a profound effect. John Tarrant does indeed bring on the rhinoceros and a host of other powerful but invisible creatures, ready to run us down when we refuse to acknowledge the fierce, awkward, and beautiful world we inhabit&#x201d;&#x2014;David Whyte, author of <i>Crossing the Unknown Sea</i><br><br>&#x201c;John Tarrant&#x2019;s talent for telling these classic Zen tales transforms them magically into a song in which, as you read, the words disappear as the music continues to echo in your mind and make you happy.

You might think that you need a foothold or a handhold. You might think that you need to improve yourself or your skills in some way. Here is a koan that suggests another possibility: the way through might be by not improving yourself and not finding a railing to take hold of.

The first experience happened when his armies had to repel an invasion of horsemen from the northwest. The horsemen carried with them whatever they owned, and they weren't afraid to die. The emperor had himself ascended to the throne in the standard way, by overthrowing the previous, weakened monarch, and he believed that he understood the riders. To steady his troops he visited the front lines and sat in the firelight on a small hill. This is when the emperor had his first peculiar experience.<br><br>Banners whipped loudly overhead and the wind felt as though it were inside his chest, tearing and banging. Something of the desert's tedious immensity was conveyed to him. The wind cleansed him of any anxiety and also took away other things the solidity of which he had never questioned before. It took away his august rank and his name. He stopped planning, and he also stopped thinking about the outcome of the battle. When everything he usually depended upon was gone, he knew immediately what to do. In the predawn, just before the nomads liked to attack, he sent horsemen into the center of their camp and immediately pulled them back again. As the pursuit came, the center of his line kept falling back. The nomads rode into the vacuum he had opened and he closed on them from both sides.<br><br>After his return, while the ministers celebrated, the emperor went into the garden to be alone. On the hillside, he had felt quite certain that he was going to win. At that moment, in the wind and the vast land, he was small and unimportant, and this sense of his unimportance allowed him to be clear about what needed to be done. Being important now seemed to him to be just a prejudice that confined him.<br><br>Once he forgot about having a special point to his life, he felt remarkably free for an emperor. There were some complications. On certain days he considered leaving his room but couldn't find a reason to. He still gave interviews at court before dawn but was sometimes beset by a sense of unreality. Shedding his old beliefs had not been so hard. He hadn't done anything to achieve his new way of seeing things; it was a gift from wind and war. Having opinions about life--ideas about being an emperor, about his own dignity and the motives of his ministers, having to dislike this person and admire that one--pained him now; he could feel these familiar attitudes as walls crowding around him. Yet some understanding, he was certain, eluded him. He did what was necessary out of duty and didn't mourn his old certainties, but he lacked delight. There had to be more to life than the freedom of pointlessness.<br><br>The emperor sought hints from the world. He noticed that he had remorse about the murders involved in his ascent to the throne. His qualms, as he thought of them, were the beginning of a new curiosity about his own life. At the same time he began to entertain famous teachers who passed through. Sometimes they were helpful. They usually praised him and gave carefully bland advice, often involving diets. Sometimes it was even good advice, but the question he had was something like a feeling--a mingling of excitement and uneasiness hard to formulate--and advice didn't seem to touch it.<br><br>Then the emperor heard of a sage from India. The man was himself a legend; it was said that it had taken him three years to make his way over the seas. The emperor knew nothing about the sea, but he imagined waves as the grass of the steppes in a high wind. He tried thinking of China as an ocean that he passed through, and nomads as pirates with horses. Though his own obligations prevented him from undertaking such journeys, he respected this kind of solitary accomplishment.<br><br>When this sage arrived at court, he turned out to be a genuine barbarian: red hair, blue eyes, dressed in rags. His name was Bodhidharma, which was not really a personal name, just some sort of title in Sanskrit. The clothes of the ministers were gorgeous, and in the red-and-gold audience room the visitor managed to seem nondescript, which was an achievement for a barbarian. He didn't have the air of one deprived or poor; the main contrast with the ministers was not in how he dressed. In a place where everyone wanted something, he did not. The ministers' rank was displayed by differences in insignia and dress; the sage made no claims about rank. He didn't either push himself forward into the emperor's notice or pull himself back into hiding. He stood quietly, and his presence affected the court until everyone fell silent. The emperor noticed that his own thoughts were becoming simple; he remembered the taste of vegetable soup.<br><br>"Even the most elegant palace," thought the emperor, "is also a burden." Then he stood up as if to approach the visitor's stillness. He wanted to find a road deeper into his own life, and asked,<br><br>"I have funded many monasteries; what merit have I earned?"<br><br>"No merit," said Bodhidharma.<br><br>With a jolt, the emperor thought, "Here is someone who knows! It's not about building things up. It's about undoing everything." He realized that he had fallen into being an emperor again and underestimated the sage and perhaps himself. He had not dared to ask a question important to his own life. The memory of a hillside and a battle rose up in him. He had had no language for what he had undergone, had had no one to stand beside him and say, "Yes, I see it too!" Now the emperor felt the man's presence as a kind of sympathy, which he longed to explore.<br><br>"What is the main point of this holy teaching?"<br><br>"Vast emptiness, nothing holy," said Bodhidharma.<br><br>Again the quiet voice that didn't ask to be heard. The emperor's senses became keen. It was as if the two men were sitting together on a bench in a temple garden with all the time in the world. He wanted to reach the other man's mind, or perhaps go deeper into his own mind. An odd thought came to him: "If I'm an emperor, how can I also be a person?" So he asked, "Who are you, standing in front of me?"<br><br>"I do not know," said Bodhidharma.<br><br>This statement stopped the emperor completely. He began to feel a delightful insubstantiality. The emperor's sadness over the shameful things he had done fell away, it fell into that emptiness. The emperor's worry over when more attacks would come from the north also disappeared. Inside himself he couldn't find an emperor.<br><br>He felt capable of many things but not quite yet; the words "I don't know, I don't know" stuck in his head like a line from a song. For a moment, he walked alone and was content. Around him, emptiness flowed in all directions. Then, as he looked about, the palace returned and the court officials started to whisper to each other. He was fascinated by how clear everything was. Someone else spoke, and Bodhidharma began to withdraw, as if he were himself a spell that had been lifted. If he had stayed, "I don't know" might have lost its power. In the court, only one person noted his going.<br><br>Later, the emperor raised this matter with his advisor, Duke Zhi. The advisor asked, "Your Majesty, do you know who that Indian sage was?"<br><br>"No, I don't," said the emperor, realizing how much emperors take for granted.<br><br>"That was Avalokiteshvara, the Bodhisattva of Compassion, carrying the seal of the Buddha's heart and mind."<br><br>The emperor felt a sudden regret and said, "Send a messenger to call him back."<br><br>Duke Zhi told him, "Your Majesty, even if everyone in the kingdom went after him he wouldn't return....</p><h2>Introduction to Tessellations</h2><p>Presents an introduction to tessellations and geometric design, including polygons, Islamic art designs, Escher-type tessellations, and tessellating letters, along with step-by-step instructions for creating tessellations.</p><p></p><h2>British Cruisers of the Victorian Era</h2><p>Gradually evolving from the masted steam frigates of the mid-nineteenth century, the first modern cruiser is not easy to define, but for the sake of this book the starting point is taken to be Iris and Mercury of 1875.

The story ends with the last armoured cruisers, which were succeeded by the first battlecruisers (originally called armoured cruisers), and with the last Third Class Cruisers (Topaze class), all conceived before 1906. Coverage, therefore, dovetails precisely with Friedman&#39;s previous book on British cruisers, although this one also includes the wartime experience of the earlier ships.rn The two central themes are cruisers for the fleet and cruisers for overseas operations, including (but not limited to) trade protection. The distant-waters aspect covers the belted cruisers, which were nearly capital ships, intended to deal with foreign second-class battleships in the Far East. The main enemies contemplated during this period were France and Russia, and the book includes British assessments of their strength and intentions, with judgements as to how accurate those assessments were.rn As would be expected of Friedman, the book is deeply researched, original in its analysis, and full of striking insights - another major contribution to the history of British warships.</p><p>Gradually evolving from the masted steam frigates of the mid-19th century, the first modern cruiser is not easy to define, but the starting point for this work is the construction of the Iris and Mercury of 1875.

Wayne Collins made a somewhat unlikely hero. An Irish American lawyer with a volatile temper, Collins's passionate commitment to the nation's constitutional principles put him in opposition to not only the United States government but also groups that acquiesced to internment such as the national office of the ACLU and the leadership of the Japanese American Citizens League. Through careful research and legal analysis, Charles Wollenberg takes readers through each case, and offers readers an understanding of how Collins came to be the most effective defender of the rights and liberties of the West Coast's Japanese and Japanese American population. Wollenberg portrays Collins not as a white knight but as a tough, sometimes difficult man whose battles gave people of Japanese descent the foundation on which to construct their own powerful campaigns for redress.</p><p>Charles Wollenberg, former Chair of Social Sciences and Professor of History at Berkeley City College, is coeditor, with Marcia A.

Westlake offers several detours along the way and four--perhaps five--interrelated plots, as well as a boxcar load of quirky characters. William Dufris brings all his skills to this Westlake entertainment. The main characters are from New York and New Jersy, giving Dufris a chance to explore the heights of their accents. He makes each main character a recognizable individual and creates memorable versions of the cameo roles, which range from Club Med staffers to Florida bonefishermen. He also handles women's voices expertly. All this while delivering a well-paced narration.

Despite Frevisse's devotion to the religious routine of prayer and silence (not absolute) and her infrequent contact with those outside the nunnery of St. Frideswide, she remains an astute observer and interpreter of what she does see. Duty sends her into the troubled household of Squire Robert as companion to Dame Claire, who is asked to minister to Robert's pregnant wife, Blaunche. A dispute over a manor claimed by Lady Blaunche before she wed Robert threatens to erupt into armed conflict. Robert, against Blaunche's wish, hopes to negotiate a settlement with Sir Lewis Allesley by marrying his ward, Katherine, to Allesley's son, Drew. Blaunche wants not only to keep the disputed manor but to see her son (and Robert's stepson), Benedict, wed Katherine. Frevisse and Claire are thrown into the middle of a squall of desires, jealousies and intrigue that begins before they reach Robert's manor and won't end before murder is done. Frevisse once again must use her skills to solve a crime. Finely plotted and subtly shaded, Frazer's tale has the detailed substance that brings an era to life, while her characters' psychological makeup is as cunningly wrought as the historical background. (Dec. 12) Forecast: This is a veteran series that continues to grow in qualityDand popularity. If booksellers focus on this title and its medieval setting (and push it to readers of history as well as to mystery buffs), the book's Christmas-time pub date could make it Frazer's bestselling to date. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Scooby Apocalypse Vol. 4</h2><p><b>The fate of humanity rests in the hands--and paws--of a very different Mystery, Inc. as Fred, Velma, Daphne, Shaggy and the superintelligent Scooby-Doo learn more about the bizarre threats they now face every day in <i>Scooby Apocalypse Volume 4</i>!</b><br><br>A visit to a small town seemingly untouched by the nanite plague that turned the world into a monster-infested wasteland puts the gang at the heart of tragedy, as new allies Cliffy and Daisy have a hard time dealing with what the gang has had to become to stay alive.

But what of those artists who don't toe the fashionable line? Erich Wolfgang Korngold, like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, was a child prodigy. Also like Mozart, he had a domineering father. Julius Korngold was a musical archconservative and he carefully guided the genius of his second son into respectable forms of musical expression, even while others began experimenting with serialism and jazz. <p> When their native Austria was incorporated into the Third Reich, the Korngolds wisely took up residence in America, where Erich earned a comfortable living scoring music for Hollywood blockbusters. Korngold was a perfectionist with an almost operatic approach to his film work, but his tonal proclivities and work in popular music ruined his status as a serious musician--at least in the eyes of the musical establishment. The last few years have seen a rise in Korngold's popularity among America's musical movers and shakers, and a new appreciation for his work, cinematic and otherwise, has developed. Jessica Duchen's well-considered discussion of the life and work of this intriguing man should continue the much-needed rehabilitation of the long-embattled tonal composers of this century.</p>Erich Wolfgang Korngold (1897-1957) is an extraordinary figure who bridged the worlds of serious music, operetta and film scores, from Mahler to Errol Flynn. Now, as his concert and stage music is also enjoying a great revival of interest, this study offers a reappraisal of Korngold&#39;s life and work, revealing a great sense of personal integrity and conviction for musical ideals which are the hallmarks of a true artist.</p><h2>The Faery Reel: Tales from the Twilight Realm</h2><p>A fantastical collection of tales, from such authors as Charles de Lint, Delia Sherman, Tanith Lee, Neil Gaiman, and Hiromi Goto, visits the enchanting, frightening, and infuriating world of the faery.

Dunn illuminates the nuanced, often imperceptible relationshipsthat exist between homo sapiens and other species, relationships that underpinhumanity&#x2019;s ability to thrive and prosper in every circumstance. Readers ofMichael Pollan&#x2019;s <em>TheOmnivore&#x2019;s Dilemma </em>will be enthralled by Dunn&#x2019;s powerful, lucid explorationof the role that humankind plays within the greater web of life on Earth.</p></p><p><p>A biologist shows the influence of wild species on our well-being and the world and how nature still clings to us&#x2014;and always will.</p><p>We evolved in a wilderness of parasites, mutualists, and pathogens, but we no longer see ourselves as being part of nature and the broader community of life. In the name of progress and clean living, we scrub much of nature off our bodies and try to remove whole kinds of life&#x2014;parasites, bacteria, mutualists, and predators&#x2014;to allow ourselves to live free of wild danger. Nature, in this new world, is the landscape outside, a kind of living painting that is pleasant to contemplate but nice to have escaped. </p><p>The truth, though, according to biologist Rob Dunn, is that while "clean living" has benefited us in some ways, it has also made us sicker in others. We are trapped in bodies that evolved to deal with the dependable presence of hundreds of other species. As Dunn reveals, our modern disconnect from the web of life has resulted in unprecedented effects that immunologists, evolutionary biologists, psychologists, and other scientists are only beginning to understand. Diabetes, autism, allergies, many anxiety disorders, autoimmune diseases, and even tooth, jaw, and vision problems are increasingly plaguing bodies that have been removed from the ecological context in which they existed for millennia. </p><p>In this eye-opening, thoroughly researched, and well-reasoned book, Dunn considers the crossroads at which we find ourselves. Through the stories of visionaries, Dunn argues that we can create a richer nature, one in which we choose to surround ourselves with species that benefit us, not just those that, despite us, survive.</p><p>Rob Dunn is an associate professor in the Department of Biological Sciences at North Carolina State University and the author of several books, including <em>Every Living Thing</em>.

Opening materials include definitions, polar and equatorial sky maps, and instructions on using the book. The bulk of this spiral-bound volume is arranged chronologically, featuring the part of the sky best observed each month of the year. Each entry focuses on a specific constellation and its component stars and includes a photo of that area of the sky. Six of the pictures have a plastic overlay that shows the outline of the constellation. Interspersed between months are spreads on topics such as the evolution and types of stars, the sun, planets and other solar system objects, nebulae, and galaxies. There is minimal text, with most information conveyed through detailed captions or the images themselves. Added features include numerous sidebars with factual data, such as dates of future eclipses, brief biographies of famous astronomers, and statistics on heavenly bodies. The information is concise, yet the author does not shy away from complex topics such as parallax and red shifts. Profusely and beautifully illustrated, the book features numerous pictures of celestial objects and clear, easy-to-understand diagrams. Jack Challoner's <i>The Atlas of Space</i> (Copper Beech, 2001) is similar and more detailed, but lacks the visual impact and abundance of star maps of Scagell's title.<i>&#x2013;Jeffrey A.

After 60 years of silence, The Diary of Mary Berg is poised at last to gain the appreciation and widespread attention that it so richly deserves, and is certain to take it&#x2019;s place alongside The Diary of Anne Frank as one of the most significant memoirs of the twentieth century. From love to tragedy, seamlessly combining the everyday concerns of a growing teenager with a unique commentary on life in one of the darkest contexts of history. This is a work remarkable for its authenticity, detail, and poignancy. But it is not only as a factual report on the life and death of a people that The Diary of Mary Berg ranks with the most noteworthy documents of the Second World War. This is the personal story of a life-loving girl&#x2019;s encounter with unparalleled human suffering, a uniquely illuminating insight into one of the darkest chapters of history. Mary Berg was imprisoned in the ghetto from 1940 to 1943. Unlike so many others, she survived the war, rescued in a prisoner-of-war exchange due to her mother&#x2019;s dual Polish-American nationality. Her diary was published in 1945 when she was still only 19, in an attempt to alert the world to the Nazi atrocities in Poland, when it was described as "one of the most heartbreaking documents yet to come out of the war" by the /New Yorker/. After the war, Berg remained in America in quiet anonimity.</p><p>Professor Susan Pentlin of Central Missouri State University is Emeritus Professor of Modern Languags at Central Missouri State University in Warrensburg, MO, and the leading expert on this work.<i>Starred Review.</i> Today I am fifteen years old. I feel very old and lonely.... Everyone is afraid to go out. The Germans are here." So begins this extraordinary memoir of Jewish life in Lodz, Poland, and the Warsaw ghetto as the Nazis began to liquidate its starving and disease-ridden inmates. In 1940 Berg fled Lodz with her parents and sister. They lived in the Warsaw ghetto, and in July 1942 were transferred to Pawiak prison within the ghetto. Originally published in the U.S. in February 1945, the memoir is based on notebooks that Mary Berg (n�e Wattenberg) smuggled out of Europe when she and her interned family were traded for German prisoners and sailed to America. This powerful testament documents Nazi brutalities, and the difference between those without means, who starved and died of typhus, and the more privileged, like Berg's family (her mother was American and her father relatively wealthy), who, for a time, were able to patronize ghetto cafes and attend the theater. Berg is a remarkably clear-eyed, skillful and heart-breaking recorder of those terrible years. 23 illus. <i>(Apr. 12)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

At an early age, he received a trumpet as a gift from his father. He practiced obsessively and eventually joined a California dance band. After graduating from high school, he ventured to New York City to study art under the tutelage of Joan Sloan and Harry Wickey at the Art Students' League. He managed to support himself throughout his schooling by playing his trumpet evenings, in nightclubs and at weddings.<br><br>Gradually, he eased into making a living sketching impressions of Broadway shows for <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>The Herald Tribune</i>. This shift was helped along, in no small part, by a rather heartbreaking incident: he lost his trumpet. One evening, he was so engrossed in sketching people on the subway, he simply forgot it was sitting on the seat beside him. This new career turned out to be a near-perfect fit for Don, though, as he had always loved the theater.<br><br>He was introduced to the world of children&#x2019;s literature when William Saroyan asked him to illustrate several books. Soon after, he began to write and illustrate his own books, a career he settled into comfortably and happily. Through his writing, he was able to create his own theater: "I love the flow of turning the pages, the suspense of what's next. Ideas just come at me and after me. It's all so natural. I work all the time, long into the night, and it's such a pleasure. I don't know when the time ends. I've never been happier in my life!"<br><br>Don died in 1978, after a long and successful career.

She has said that her writing has at its core &#x201c;the attempt to identify what it is to be a half-breed or mixed-blood person.&#x201d; As she grew up on the Laguna Pueblo Reservation, she learned the stories and culture of the Laguna people from her great-grandmother and other female relatives. After receiving her B. A. in English at the University of New Mexico, she enrolled in the University of New Mexico law school but completed only three semesters before deciding that writing and storytelling, not law, were the means by which she could best promote justice. She married John Silko in 1970. Prior to the writing of <i>Ceremony</i>, she published a series of short stories, including &#x201c;The Man to Send Rain Clouds.&#x201d; She also authored a volume of poetry, <i>Laguna Woman: Poems</i>, for which she received the Pushcart Prize for Poetry. <p>In 1973, Silko moved to Ketchikan, Alaska, where she wrote <i>Ceremony</i>. Initially conceived as a comic story abut a mother&#x2019;s attempts to keep her son, a war veteran, away from alcohol, <i>Ceremony</i> gradually transformed into an intricate meditation on mental disturbance, despair, and the power of stories and traditional culture as the keys to self-awareness and, eventually, emotional healing. Having battled depression herself while composing her novel, Silko was later to call her book &#x201c;a ceremony for staying sane.&#x201d; Silko has followed the critical success of <i>Ceremony</i> with a series of other novels, including <i>Storyteller, Almanac for the Dead</i>, and <i>Gardens in the Dunes</i>. Nevertheless, it was the singular achievement of <i>Ceremony</i> that first secured her a place among the first rank of Native American novelists.

My elder son, Robert Chapman, was seven years old, and Cazimir was eighteen months. Ketchikan was John Silko&#x2019;s hometown, and he&#x2019;d taken a supervisory position in the legal services office in Ketchikan. I had a book contract with Viking Press because Richard Seaver, who was a Viking editor, saw my short stories in Ken Rosen&#x2019;s anthology, <i>The Man to Send Rain Clouds</i>. At the time I thought it was odd that my book contract specified either a collection of short stories or a novel. I didn&#x2019;t have a literary agent then to explain that publishers preferred novels. I had no intention of writing anything but short stories for Viking Press; I felt confident about the short story as a genre, but aside from being a voracious reader of novels from age ten, I neglected to take that course the English Department offered on The Novel. No way I was going to mess with success. Short stories, that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;d write. I used my writer&#x2019;s grant from the National Endowment for the Arts to pay for day care for Caz while Robert was in school.</p><p>Located on Revillagigedo Island, 750 miles north of Seattle, Ketchikan had a mild climate by Alaskan standards due in large part to a warm ocean current named the Japanese Current. The average year-round temperature was forty-eight degrees, and the average rainfall was 180 inches. In Chinle the annual rainfall was twelve inches in a good year. I was accustomed to the bright sunlight of the Southwest, where the weather permitted activity outdoors all year around. In southeastern Alaska the tall spruce trees, the heavy clouds, fogs and mist and the steep mountains enclosed the town. In the Southwest I was accustomed to gazing into distances of forty or fifty miles. I was accustomed to seeing the sky and the stars and moon.</p><p>The change in climate had a profound effect on me; I spent all of June, July, and August fighting off the terrible lethargy of a depression caused in large part by the absence of sunlight. I managed to write one short story during that time, about a woman who drowned herself; it wasn&#x2019;t a good short story but a message to myself. In September after the boys were in day care and school, I tried to write at home but I found it difficult to concentrate: the dirty dishes and dirty laundry seemed to cry out for attention.</p><p>About this time Richard Whittaker came to my aid. Dick and his family lived across the street from my Silko in-laws. He practiced Indian law mostly for the local tribes, and he was a strong supporter of the Alaska Legal Services program, which employed my husband. Dick was a reader of novels and especially admired Kurt Vonnegut&#x2019;s <i>God Bless You, Mr. Rosewater</i>. I talked about needing a place to write, and Dick Whittaker invited me to use the table and chair in his closet-sized law library. His law office was located on the second floor of the building that housed the offices of the legal services program. The building is still there overlooking Ketchikan Creek, next to the great Chief Johnson totem pole with Raven and Fog Woman at the corner of Mission Street and Stedman Street.</p><p>I worked on the library table with my Hermes portable typewriter and a fountain pen. Once I saw what I&#x2019;d typed, I immediately edited with a fountain pen. Every day I read the previous day&#x2019;s writing to get myself started again. Luckily I was in the early stages when I didn&#x2019;t have much manuscript or many notes, because of course I could not leave my work spread out over the law library table: Dick Whittaker and his staff did need to use the law books from time to time. I wrote the short story &#x201c;Lullaby&#x201d; in the law library. I&#x2019;d already started to write what would become <i>Ceremony</i>, but after I heard Nash and Ada Chakee were killed, I allowed myself to stray from the novel long enough to write the short story in their memory.</p><p>After about six months, the legal services offices were moved to larger offices downtown, and I followed. There was a tiny office space there, but without a door. Some of the early draft of <i>Ceremony</i> is written on the back side of discarded legal services letterhead. I managed there for a couple of months until Dick Whittaker told me he couldn&#x2019;t find a renter for the office space vacated by legal services. Rent free, he gave me the exclusive use of the space complete with heat and lights and, best of all, no telephone.</p><p>There was an outer room that had been for reception, and the inner office that had windows that looked out on Raven and Fog Woman above Ketchikan Creek. The inner office had a chair and a wide, long built-in plywood work area shaped like a wing. The first thing I did was buy a can of Chinese red enamel and paint the plywood desk top. I brought an old percolator down to make hot water for instant coffee. Some days when I got to my office I didn&#x2019;t feel like working on the novel so I wrote letters to the new friends I&#x2019;d met at a writers conference in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in June of 1973. Other days I&#x2019;d scoot the Hermes and manuscript over and I&#x2019;d stretch out on top of the work area for a nap.</p><p>My rule for myself was this: I had to stay in that room whether I wrote or not, and, finally, after I&#x2019;d written letters to Mei-Mei Berssenbrugge or Lawson Inada, the poets who provided me with moral support, or taken a nap, I&#x2019;d walk over to the window to look up at the big black raven carved above me on the top of the pole. A long way down the pole came Raven&#x2019;s two raven helpers, Gitsanuk and Gitsaqeq, their raven beaks oddly hooked, melted from the fire&#x2019;s heat the time they carried Raven&#x2019;s gift of fire to human beings. Then came the figures of Raven and his wife, Fog Woman, who held two salmon by the tails. The beauty of the carved figures lifted my spirits and I&#x2019;d finally break down my resistance, and start work on the novel.</p><p>At the time I didn&#x2019;t know much about the Chief Johnson pole or the story of Raven and Fog Woman, but later I learned what an auspicious location my writing office had. The Chief Johnson pole was set in 1901 to celebrate the potlatch given by Chief Johnson for the Kadjuk Tlingits. The carved figures recalled Raven&#x2019;s beloved wife, Fog Woman, who used Raven&#x2019;s spruce root hat to create the first salmon. Soon the rivers and ocean were jammed with salmon, and suddenly Raven was rich. Once he was rich, he began to neglect Fog Woman, and one day he spoke abusively to her until she ran toward the beach where she turned into fog. Raven told himself it didn&#x2019;t matter, but when he got home he found all the dried salmon he&#x2019;d stored came to life again and swam out to sea and Raven was as poor as before. The figure of Fog Woman on the pole faces the ocean at the place the salmon enter the creek to spawn; Fog Woman&#x2019;s gift of the salmon made the people of Ketchikan rich.</p><p>Lunchtime was easy. Mrs. Hirabayashi&#x2019;s caf� was only a half block away, on the street across from the docks and the fishing fleet. Mrs. Hirabayashi and her mother ran the place. It had a long white marble counter with stools where the fishermen liked to sit. They grew aged poinsettias plants in the caf� front window. It might have been a soda fountain at one time. The Hirabayashis, like other Japanese Americans, were imprisoned in internment camps during the war, and it was Gordon Hirabayashi, Mrs. Hirabayashi&#x2019;s son, who with others worked tirelessly to secure redress for the crime from the U.S. Congress.</p><p>Mrs. Hirabayashi welcomed all her customers with a joyous greeting, and her elderly mother working behind the stove smiled shyly and nodded. I always ordered the same thing: green tea and a bowl of pork noodles. Except for me and a few old Tlingit and Haida people, the Hirabayshis&#x2019; customers were fishermen in rubber boots and gray wool halibut jackets. Usually it was raining. My first October, in 1973, Ketchikan got 42.5 inches of rain in thirty-one days. So after my noodles and tea, I usually went straight back to my writing and worked until three, when it was time to fetch Caz from day care to be home when Robert returned from school.</p><p>If it wasn&#x2019;t raining too hard, sometimes I wandered around downtown Ketchikan just looking at the fishing boats or giant cruise ships and the vast flotillas of spruce logs towed by tug-boats to the pulp mill. Big ravens cavorted on the docks in search of tidbits from the fishing boats, but most amazing to my eyes were the great bald eagles, a dozen or more, that lounged or played in the tops of tall spruce while they waited to dive into the water for salmon. After a while I realized that Raven and Eagle still owned the town; the old-time tribal people belonged to the clans of Killer Whale, Grizzly Bear, and Wolf. Humans belonged to Halibut and King Salmon and Steel Head Trout clans too; surrounded by ocean, rivers, creeks, and rainwater, the watery clans seemed a safer bet. The totern poles often had small wan faces of &#x201c;drowned men&#x201d; carved between the major figures&#x2014;I couldn&#x2019;t swim and boats made me seasick&#x2014;the small wan face might be me.</p><p>Once I started writing the novel, the depression lifted, but then came the terrible migraine headaches, worse than any I&#x2019;d had since the tenth grade. I stayed in a darkened bedroom for eight hours at a time while the vertigo spun the bed. Fortunately, as the main character, Tayo, began to recover from his illness, I too began to feel better, and had fewer headaches. By this time, the novel was my refuge, my magic vehicle back to the Southwest land of sandstone mesas, blue sky, and sun. As I described the sandstone spring, the spiders, water bugs, swallows, and rattlesnakes, I remade the place in words; I was no longer on a dark rainy island thousands of miles away. I was home, from time immemorial, as the old ones liked to say to us children long ago.</p><p>I wasn&#x2019;t just homesick for the sandstone cliffs and the sun; I missed the people and the storytelling, so I incorporated into the novel the old-time story about Hummingbird and Green Fly, who help the people purify their town to bring back the Corn Mother. The title of the novel, <i>Ceremony</i>, refers to the healing ceremonies based on the ancient stories of the Din� and Pueblo people. The two years I lived and taught for Din� College were important to my understanding of the healing ceremony&#x2019;s relationship to storytelling. I was conscious of constructing the novel out of many different kinds of narratives or stories to celebrate storytelling with the spoken as well as the written word. I indulged myself with the old-time stories because they evoked a feeling of comfort I remembered from my childhood at Laguna.</p><p>During this time the wet climate did not agree with my younger son, Cazimir, who was twice hospitalized for acute asthma. Grandma Lillie, on a visit to Ketchikan, suffered a heart attack. At crisis times I completely forgot the novel, but afterward the need to return to the work became overwhelming. The novel was my escape, and I remember how I fretted on weekends because I was so anxious to keep working. I wasn&#x2019;t sure what I was writing qualified as a &#x201c;novel.&#x201d;</p><p>It was supposed to be a funny story about Harley, the Wor...</p></p><h2>Across the Arctic Ocean: Original Photographs from the Last Great Polar Journey</h2><p><p><strong>An unparalleled look at the first surface crossing of the Arctic Ocean, and probably the first expedition to reach the North Pole by surface travel, through the words and images of the man who led it</strong></p> On February 21, 1968, Wally Herbert and his team of three companions and forty huskies set out from Point Barrow, Alaska, embarking on a route that would take them some 3,800 miles over sixteen months, across the North Pole and the frozen Arctic Ocean via its longest axis.

His vivid and energetic record of that experience, The Making of a Chef, takes us to the heart of this food-knowledge mecca. Here we meet a coterie of talented chefs, an astonishing and driven breed. Ruhlman learns fundamental skills and information about the behavior of food that make cooking anything possible. Ultimately, he propels himself and his readers through a score of kitchens and classrooms, from Asian and American regional cuisines to lunch cookery and even table waiting, in search of the elusive, unnameable elements of great cooking.<br></p><p>Journalist Michael Ruhlman talked his way into the CIA: the Culinary Institute of America, the Harvard of cooking schools. It had something to do with potatoes a grand-uncle had eaten deacades earlier, how the man could remember them so well for so long, buried as they had been in the middle of an elegant meal. Ruhlman wanted to learn how to cook potatoes like that--like an art--and the CIA seemed the place to go. The fun part of this book is that we all get to go along for the ride without having to endure the trauma of cooking school.<p> Ever wonder what goes on in a busy kitchen, why your meal comes late or shows up poorly cooked? The temptation is to blame the waiter, but there are a world of cooks behind those swinging doors, and Ruhlman marches you right into it. It's a world where, when everything is going right, time halts and consciousness expands. And when a few things go wrong, the earth begins to wobble on its axis. Ruhlamn has the writerly skills to make the education of a chef a visceral experience.</p>In the ultimate food-lover&#39;s fantasy, journalist Michael Ruhlman dons chef&#39;s jacket and houndstooth-check pants to join the students in Skills One at the Culinary Institute of America, the most influential cooking school in the country. His goal is to document the training of America&#39;s chefs from the first classroom to the Culinary&#39;s final kitchen, the American Bounty Restaurant. The result becomes more than a rote reportage of a school for cooks. Ruhlman learns to cook as though his future depends upon it, and this complete immersion enables him to create the most vivid and energetic memoir of a genuine culinary education on record. He learns fundamental skills and information about the behavior of food that make cooking anything possible. But he also finds that a professional cook needs more than just knowledge and skill. Ultimately Ruhlman propels himself and his readers through a score of kitchens and classrooms, from Asian and American regional cuisines to lunch cookery and even table waiting, in search of the elusive, unnameable elements of great cooking.</p><h2>Miguel Street</h2><p>Bogart the bigamist, B. Wordsworth the poet, and Morgan the pyrotechnist are among the poor inhabitants of Miguel Street seen through the eyes of a fatherless boy growing up in Port of Spain, Trinidad</p><p>&#x201c;A stranger could drive through Miguel Street and just say &#x2018;Slum!&#x2019; because he could see no more.&#x201d; But to its residents this derelict corner of Trinidad&#x2019;s capital is a complete world, where everybody is quite different from everybody else. There&#x2019;s Popo the carpenter, who neglects his livelihood to build &#x201c;the thing without a name.&#x201d; There&#x2019;s Man-man, who goes from running for public office to staging his own crucifixion, and the dreaded Big Foot, the bully with glass tear ducts. There&#x2019;s the lovely Mrs. Hereira, in thrall to her monstrous husband. In this tender, funny early novel, V. S. Naipaul renders their lives (and the legends their neighbors construct around them) with Dickensian verve and Chekhovian compassion.<br>Set during World War II and narrated by an unnamed&#x2013;but precociously observant&#x2013;neighborhood boy,<b> Miguel Street</b> is a work of mercurial mood shifts, by turns sweetly melancholy and anarchically funny. It overflows with life on every page.&#x201c;One of the few contemporary writers of whom we can speak in terms of greatness.&#x201d; &#x2013;Mel Gussow, <i>Newsday</i><br><br>&#x201c;Miguel Street is the Bowery, the Tenderloin, and the Catfish Row of Trinidad&#x2019;s Port of Spain&#x2013;its citizens a loony multitude whose knavery often rises from real kinship with pathos and tragedy. . . . Naipaul is at his best in these swift caricatures of human depravity.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br><br>&#x201c;Amusing and poignant. . . . Excellent reading.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Chicago Tribune</i><br><br>&#x201c;Naipaul does not tell stories. By some miraculous sleight-of-hand he takes you to Port of Spain and shows you the rich, bawdy, consequential lives of the Trinidadians, as though there were no intervening veil of words. . . . I rather suspect the mantle of Chekhov has fallen on Mr. Naipaul&#x2019;s shoulders.&#x201d; &#x2013;Robert Payne, <i>Saturday Review</i></p><h2>Elegantly Easy Creme Brulee : &amp; Other Custard Desserts</h2><p><p>At last, creme brulee has been demystified.

Many years later Maxine Hong Kingston wrote a Fourth Book of Peace, but it too was burned--in the catastrophic Berkeley-Oakland Hills fire of 1991, a fire that coincided with the death of her father. Now in this visionary and redemptive work, Kingston completes her interrupted labor, weaving fiction and memoir into a luminous meditation on war and peace, devastation and renewal.</p><p>Maxine Hong Kingston is the daughter of Chinese immigrants who operated a gambling house in the 1940s, when Maxine was born, and then a laundry where Kingston and her brothers and sisters toiled long hours. Kingston graduated with a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in 1962 from the University of California at Berkeley, and, in the same year, married actor Earll Kingston, whom she had met in an English course. The couple has one son, Joseph, who was born in 1963. They were active in antiwar activities in Berkeley, but in 1967 the Kingstons headed for Japan to escape the increasing violence and drugs of the antiwar movement. They settled instead in Hawai&#x2018;i, where Kingston took various teaching posts. They returned to California seventeen years later, and Kingston resumed teaching writing at the University of California, Berkeley.<br><br>While in Hawai&#x2018;i, Kingston wrote her first two books. <b>The Woman Warrior</b>, her first book, was published in 1976 and won the National Book Critics Circle Award, making her a literary celebrity at age thirty-six. Her second book, <b>China Men</b>, earned the National Book Award. Still today, both books are widely taught in literature and other classes. Kingston has earned additional awards, including the PEN West Award for Fiction for <b>Tripmaster Monkey</b>, the American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature, and the National Humanities Medal, which was conferred by President Clinton, as well as the title &#x201c;Living Treasure of Hawai&#x2018;i&#x201d; bestowed by a Honolulu Buddhist church. Her most recent books include a collection of essays, <b>Hawai</b>&#x2018;<b>i One Summer</b>, and latest novel, <b>The Fifth Book of Peace</b>. Kingston is currently Senior Lecturer Emerita at the University of California, Berkeley.If a woman is going to write a Book of Peace, it is given her to know devastation. I have lost my book&#x2014;156 good pages. A firestorm blew over the Oakland-Berkeley hills in October of 1991, and took my house, things, neighborhood, and other neighborhoods, and forests. And the lives of twenty-five people.<br><br>I almost reached my manuscript, typescript, printouts, and disks in time. I was driving home from funeral ceremonies for my father. I have lost my father. He&#x2019;s gone less than a month; we were having the full-month ceremony early, Sunday day off. Never before had I driven by myself away from Stockton and my parents&#x2019; house. I turned on public radio for the intelligent voices, and heard that the hills were burning, toward Moraga, toward Walnut Creek. It&#x2019;s not my poor sense of direction, I told myself, but the newscasters in confusion. The perimeters of the fire were different from station to station, from taped news to live news. North of the Caldecott Tunnel, south of the Caldecott Tunnel, east, west of the Warren Freeway. I pictured wildfire far up in the hills&#x2014;ridgelines of flame spilling down, then running up sere-grass slopes. I have seen it at night&#x2014;red gashes zigzagging the black. Impossible that it cross ten lanes of freeway and take over settled, established, built city.<br><br>Behind me, my sister-in-law Cindy was chasing me at ninety miles per hour. My family believed that I didn&#x2019;t know about the fire, and would drive into it, and not be able to find my way out on the altered, burning streets. Like all the Chinese members of our family, I have an instinct that left is right and vice versa. Too easily lost. Cindy, who is not Chinese but Arkie, ran out of gas at Tracy.<br><br>In a half-hour, halfway there, forty miles to go, I was speeding over the Altamont Pass (where there be ghosts and accidents; it is the ground upon which the stabbing happened at the Rolling Stones concert, after Woodstock), and through the windfarms. Some windmills turned, and some were still. Here the winds and all seemed normal; I had no evidence that hurricanes of fire were storming on the other side of these hills but for the radio. &#x201c;Forty-five houses have gone up in flames.&#x201d; &#x201c;About a hundred homes.&#x201d; &#x201c;A hundred and fifty structures have burned.&#x201d; The numbers would keep going up&#x2014;nine hundred degrees, the temperature of molten lava; twenty-one hundred degrees, the temperature of kilns; thirty-five hundred houses. &#x201c;Winds of forty-five miles per hour . . .&#x201d; &#x201c;. . . sixty-five-mile-per-hour firewind . . .&#x201d; &#x201c;. . . record heat and winds . . .&#x201d; &#x201c;Foehn winds.&#x201d; &#x201c;Northeast winds . . .&#x201d; I would have to look up &#x201c;foehn,&#x201d; which sounds like &#x201c;wind&#x201d; in Chinese, as in &#x201c;typhoon.&#x201d; &#x201c;The fire has jumped the junction of Highway Twenty-four and Highway Thirteen.&#x201d; It&#x2019;s blown over and through ten lanes. Ten lanes are not wide enough firebreak. It&#x2019;s on our side of the freeway. &#x201c;. . . dynamite College Avenue.&#x201d; &#x201c;. . . draw the line at College Avenue.&#x201d; &#x201c;. . . helicopters and available cropdusters chemical-drop the Claremont Hotel.&#x201d; &#x201c;If the Claremont Hotel goes, explodes, the fire will burn to the Bay.&#x201d; &#x201c;No cars have been trapped in the Caldecott Tunnel.&#x201d; Once, a propane truck had exploded inside the tunnel&#x2014;a giant flamethrower pointed at Oakland.<br><br>NO TANK TRUCKS<br><br>WITH HAZARDOUS MATERIALS<br><br>ALLOWED IN CALDECOTT TUNNEL<br><br>A police car was parked sideways across my exit, Broadway Terrace. I drove fast to the next exit, which was blocked by a Highway Patrol car and flares. They are setting up the roadblocks moments ahead of me, I thought. If only I had driven faster, I might have saved the book, and my mother&#x2019;s jewelry, and my father&#x2019;s watch, and his spectacles, which fit my eyes, and his draft card, which I had taken from his wallet. &#x201c;This card is to be carried on your person at all times.&#x201d; He carried it safely for over fifty years.<br><br>When I got off the freeway, I was somewhere in downtown Oakland, and driving too slowly through complicated traffic. It was the middle of the afternoon, about two o&#x2019;clock. Too late. Too late. The sky was black. The sun was red. Leaves of burned black paper wafted high and low among the buildings. Ashes from a forest fire were falling and blowing in downtown Oakland.<br><br>In the middle of my U-turn, the radio said that Broadway and/or Broadway Terrace was on fire, and that there was looting on Ostrander Street. Parallel streets&#x2014;big Broadway Terrace for cars, little Broadway Terrace for walking&#x2014;eucalyptus and pine trees and apple trees between them&#x2014;a tree-high, two-street-thick wall of flame. Mass fire. I said out loud, &#x201c;No. No. No. No.&#x201d; Ostrander is&#x2014;was?&#x2014;a one-way road through a small woods on a hill. On my walks to and from the Village Market, families of quail would surprise me. They walked ahead just so far, as if leading me, or as if I were giving chase, then took off running into the bushes, and flying up into the lower branches of the oaks and pines. Once, on Ostrander, I stood amazed at the center of a storm of birds&#x2014;hundreds of robins, jays, and chickadees&#x2014;flying touch-and-go, on and off treetops and roofs and grass, circling and crisscrossing singly and in schools, and never bumping into one another&#x2014;better than the Blue Angels. I love looking out at Oakland and seeing a crane extend itself over the city. So&#x2014;their flyway can sweep this far west, and they rest at Lake Merritt or Lake Anza or Temescal. Anne Frank saw cranes out the sky window. Another time, riding BART, as the train came up out of the Bay into Oakland, I saw twelve angels wheeling in the sun, rays of white wings and gold light. &#x201c;Swans!&#x201d; I said loudly; the other passengers had to see them too. &#x201c;Look. Swans.&#x201d;<br><br>It can&#x2019;t be too late. All I want is a minute inside the house&#x2014;run to the far end of the living room, to the alcove where my book is in a wine box, take one more breath, and run upstairs for the gold and jade that my ancestresses had been able to keep safe through wars in China and world wars and journeys across oceans and continents.<br><br>Where Broadway meets the start of College Avenue, at the California College of Arts and Crafts (where Wittman kissed Ta�a; but I&#x2019;ll get to that), only a few feet from the sign pointing up to Broadway Terrace, the police were herding cars down and away to College Avenue. I stopped at the light, left the car, and ran over to talk them into letting me through. Even though the light turned green, the line of cars I&#x2019;d blocked did not honk; nobody yelled. I wished for a hand gesture to communicate Sorry, to use in traffic situations. Sorry. Thank you. I asked a policeman, &#x201c;Are you absolutely sure I can&#x2019;t drive up there?&#x201d; He answered that no cars were allowed past this point. I thought, May I go to my house on foot, then? I got back in the car, drove diagonally across the intersection, and parked in the red-curb stop for the College Avenue bus. The police shouldn&#x2019;t write tickets on this terrible day. Twenty-eight dollars, worth it. Have mercy on this car that could very well have been left here by someone who had escaped the fire and was getting a drink of water, parking as close as she could to home.<br><br>I stood at the curb plotting how I was going to fade past the police, and got in step with an African American family with many children crossing the street. I told them I lived on Golden Gate Avenue and was trying to go up there; where did they live? They lived on Brookside, which winds around Golden Gate. I asked, &#x201c;Were you officially evacuated? Has our area been officially evacuated yet?&#x201d; They didn&#x2019;t know, but they had been back to their house. The father said, &#x201c;The police will escort you home if you tell them you have a life-and-death situation.&#x201d; The mother said, &#x201c;They drove us to our house.&#x201d; I asked, &#x201c;What was the life-and-death situation you told them?&#x201d; &#x201c;We couldn&#x2019;t find our son. Our son was missing.&#x201d; The kids, all about junior-high age, were smiling and safe; I couldn&#x2019;t tell which was the one lost and now found. An unfinished book is nothing as important as a child. I told the family that I was trying to save the manuscript of a book I was writing. Said out loud in the open to actual people, who did not get excited, my plight did not seem to have enormity. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been working on it for years,&#x201d; I said. About one and a half to two years of pure writing, not counting thinking and imagining. Is one and a half to two years much? It depends on which years. Didn&#x2019;t Rilke write <i>The Duino Elegies</i> in six months? Or was it six hours one wide-awake night? He did it about ten years before his death at fifty-one. The happy family and I wished each other Good luck and Take care.<br><br>While the policemen&#x2014;the Oakland cops aren&#x2019;t as big as during the Viet Nam demonstrations&#x2014;were busy, I walked through the barricades into the defined fire area. Householders were staying, hosing down roofs and dry lawns. A flare of fire fell out of the sky and landed behind a man intent on watering his property. I motioned to him that he should look to his rear, but he stared at me as if I were a crazy woman, pointing at my own butt. I didn&#x2019;t try to shout over the helicopters; they chopped up sound and the air, and whupped up heartbeats. Anyway, only now, as I write, am I coming up with words for the things that were making wild appearances and disappearances. That flame went out; another fell out of nowhere onto his roof. Even if he saw it, he couldn&#x2019;t have reached it with the spray from his garden hose. I ran on.<br><br>I felt afraid when there was not a person in sight. I ran up the center of the street, between the houses, locked up tight. I wanted to run faster, through and out of this deserted place. But I was trying to breathe shallowly. The car radio had said that poison oak was burning; I coughed, thinking of breathing poison-oak smoke, which must blister lungs. The air smelled poisonous&#x2014;toxic polymers, space-age plastics, petrochemicals, refrigerants, Freon, radon. I am breathing carcinogens, I will die of lung cancer. I held my long white hair as a filter over my nose and mouth and ran at a pace that allowed me to control my wind. I passed side streets without deciding to turn left into one. Many streets end in culs-de-sac, or loop around. I would lose time backtracking out. I wished for a photographic memory to recall the map of this area in the <i>Thomas Guide</i>. But the <i>Thomas Guide</i> only blurredly indicates the snarl of these streets, lanes, paths, and steps; they curl around boulders and oak trees and Lake Temescal and hills. From now on, wherever I live, I will pay attention to which streets go through exactly where. Pages of ash were floating high up, and also skimming along curbs. I did not stop to try to read them. Someone once told me about a child who lived at the time of the burning of a great library. He caught pages of burned paper, and read Latin words. At Margarido, a long, wide street, I turned left toward the heat and fire. I hoped that I would see again the enormous old ginkgo tree that fountains up and up&#x2014;wings, gold, autumn. I passed a man and a woman leaving their house, and a homeowner on his rooftop wetting it down. None of them could answer me: whether or not this street was officially evacuated. I arrived at the edge of the golf course, which was lined by a row of eucalyptus trees. Their tops were on fire. This is crown fire, and flames jumped from tree to tree. I imagined myself running under the eucalyptus trees, but, before I reached the open field, the trees dropping fire on my head, and me exploding. More eucalyptus trees lined the other side. (My husband, who should be at my side helping me, would tease, You&#x2019;re always afraid that things will explode. &#x201c; &#x2018;Be careful,&#x2019; &#x201d; Earll mimics me. &#x201c; &#x2018;Watch out. It&#x2019;s going to explode.&#x2019; &#x201d; But I have seen and/or heard for myself the explosions of an automobile motor, a sewing-machine motor, my electric typewriter [a cat pissed in it], a toilet, mother spiders, tules. In Phoenix Park in Dublin, I made Earll get away before a dead cow, its big stomach expanding, blew up.) Eucalyptus trees have big wood-cells filled with eucalyptus oil. The bangs I was hearing were houses, cars, and trees blowing up. If I made it across the golf course (Private Robert E. Lee Prewitt, the hero of From Here to Eternity, was killed on a golf course), I would come out at the corner of Broadway Terrace and Ostrander, amidst the fire and the looters. I turned about. Is this retreat, then, and am I giving up on my book? I let the possibility that the book was gone&#x2014;my book gone&#x2014;enter my ken. I did not feel bad; I did not believe it was lost. I had not stopped trying to rescue it. The same men were still watering down their houses, which their wives and children must have evacuated. The sky was darker now, and the air hotter. The sun was ugly red. (&#x201c;Ugly red&#x201d; are Judy Foosaner&#x2019;s words; she&#x2019;s a painter, we&#x2019;re &#x201c;friends since girls.&#x201d; She was down in the flatlands, and watched the cars exploding up on the hills. I&#x2019;d thought until she said &#x201c;ugly red&#x201d; that to a painter all colors were beautiful.)<br><br>Gravity sped me downhill, back to crowds and industrial-strength buildings. I found my red car&#x2014;no ticket&#x2014;and drove down College to Chabot Road, which was barricaded. Chabot Road was my familiar turn home. It was not right that it be an impasse. I left the car there, surprised at the free parking. Again, I became invisible to the police, and walked for home. This way seemed almost normal. I should have come up these known streets in the first place. As always, there was a stillness at St. Albert&#x2019;s College; either the monks had evacuated the seminary, or they were staying hidden. You hardly ever see them in the garden or out on the tennis courts anyway. The atmosphere feels full of prayer. The row of elm trees&#x2014;grandmother tree, grandfather tree&#x2014;stood unharmed. This was the first tree seen by me as a child, and is more magnificent each time I find another one. Some people call them Chinese elms, some call them American elms. Here was a stand of nine elms, here before I was here, and meant to outlast me. I do not remember touching them, each one, the elephant bark, the horned-toad bark, the crocogator bark, as I usually do; I must have rushed past. Their jigjag leaves were a strong green, though October was ending, and my fiftieth year was ending.<br><br>The strange shifting light&#x2014;the winds were blowing the weather and the time of day crazily up and down the street&#x2014;stilled at St. Albert&#x2019;s and started up again at Chabot Elementary, shadows swinging across the asphalt and through the cyclone fences, backstop, and jungle-gym bars. Why do we raise children on ground barren of trees and grass? We are teaching them to endure a world like a cage, a jail.<br><br>Chabot Road tails up and off into hills and forests, and Golden Gate Avenue, my street, starts to its right. This corner&#x2014;I am traveling northeast&#x2014;is a natural border between man-built city and wildland. Flats and hills, chapparal and forest also meet here. All influenced by underground rivers, and by fault lines. The wind changes its blowing; the climate turns. At such a place, you enter and leave ecosystems. Leina-a-ka-&#x2018;uhane. I was at a border of the fire, the built city behind me, and ahead black ground. I walked onto it. I could disappear, I thought. If I had continued walking northeast, up the hill, I would&#x2019;ve come to the place where the fire killed nineteen people. The slopes on either side of me had just burned. The ivy, dill, vetch, pampas plumes, and coyote bushes do not exist anymore, except in my mind.<br><br>I have been at controlled burns. Farmers weed fields by burning them down to fertile ash and black earth. The harvest fires in the cane fields run at you, and suddenly stop.

Crowds cheered as cowboys and Indians--and Annie Oakley!--galloped past on spirited horses, sharpshooters exploded glass balls tossed high in the air, and cavalry troops arrived just in time to save a stagecoach from Indian attack. Vivid posters on billboards everywhere made William Cody, the show's originator and star, a world-renowned figure.<br>Joy S. Kasson's important new book traces Cody's rise from scout to international celebrity, and shows how his image was shaped. Publicity stressed his show's "authenticity" yet audiences thrilled to its melodrama; fact and fiction converged in a performance that instantly became part of the American tradition.<br><br>But how, precisely, did that come about? How, for example, did Cody use his audience's memories of the Civil War and the Indian wars? He boasted that his show included participants in the recent conflicts it presented theatrically, yet he also claimed it evoked "memories" of America's bygone greatness. Kasson's shrewd, engaging study--richly illustrated--in exploring the disappearing boundary between entertainment and public events in American culture, shows us just how we came to imagine our memories.<br></p><p><b>Joy S. Kasson</b>, author of several books on American history, is a graduate of Radcliffe College who obtained her Ph.D. at Yale. Since 1990, she has been Professor of American Studies and English at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, where she lives.<br>A fine, entertaining, scholarly study of one of the beloved (if, until now, little-understood) figures of American history--and of how he affected our image of ourselves.Mention the name Buffalo Bill (born William F. Cody), and a great circus-like show, with Indians and gunfighters, comes immediately to mind. According to Kasson (History/Univ. of North Carolina), that image constitutes only a fraction of Cody's influence upon American culture. In her captivating study, she is not content merely to give us a fresh biography of the man who was a writer of dime novels, a great showman, an energetic (if often frustrated) businessman, one of the nation's first celebrities, and (believe it or not) a figure of the 20th century. She also reveals the extraordinary influence and following he had among millions (including Queen Victoria), both here and abroad. It was Buffalo Bill's shows that indelibly inscribed on people's minds their image of the American West, of its native inhabitants, and of human character on the western trail. Cody's appeal and success seem almost foreordained, for his showmanship owed as much to his times as it did to his skill in sensing what his contemporaries wanted. A veteran of the Civil War and the Indians campaigns, Buffalo Bill (in Kasson's view) offered authenticity to Americans fearful about the closing of the frontier, the rise of cities and industry, and the decline of individual freedom. Here was a man of courage and integrity (he fought for us), a democrat of sorts (employing Sitting Bull and Annie Oakley with dignity and respect), and a self-made entertainer who, like P.T. Barnum, purveyed much bunkum while putting on a plain good show. One of Kasson's most significant contributions is her explanation of what today's world of entertainment, as well as our era's packaging of history as fun, owes to this single figure.A wonderful account that reveals as much about us as it does about the colorful man who is its subject.

E. Lawrence</h2><p><p><strong>An intimate biography of the years that turned T. E. Lawrence into Lawrence of Arabia.</strong></p><p>Lawrence of Arabia's heroism during the Arab revolt and his disgust at the subsequent betrayal of the Arabs in the postwar negotiations have become the stuff of legend. But T. E. Lawrence&#x2019;s adventures in the Levant began long before the outbreak of war. This intimate biography is the first to focus on Lawrence in his twenties, the untold story of the awkward archaeologist from Oxford who, on first visiting "The East," fell in love with Arab culture and found his life's mission.</p><p>Few people realize that Lawrence&#x2019;s classic autobiography, <em>Seven Pillars of Wisdom</em>, was not the first book to carry that iconic title. Lawrence himself burned his original draft. Anthony Sattin here uncovers the story Lawrence wanted to conceal: the truth of his birth, his tortuous relationship with a dominant mother, his deep affection for an Arab boy, and the personal reasons that drove him from student to spy.</p><p>Drawing on surviving letters, diaries, and accounts from close confidantes, Sattin brings a biographer&#x2019;s eye for detail and a travel writer's verve to Lawrence's extraordinary journeys through the region with which his name is forever connected. In a masterful parallel narrative, <em>The Young T. E. Lawrence</em> charts the maturation of the man and the incipient countries he treasured, both coming of age at a time when the world&#x2019;s foundations were coming undone.</p> 16 pages of illustrations; 3 maps</p><p>Anthony Sattin is an award-winning journalist and the author of several acclaimed history and travel books. He has been traveling in the Middle East for more than twenty years. He lives in London.&#x201c;T. E. Lawrence has always been one of the most enigmatic figures of the twentieth century, but he becomes markedly less so here. Through meticulous research and crackling prose, Sattin charts the youthful passions and influences&#x2015;and not a few family and personal secrets&#x2015;that helped create the future Lawrence of Arabia, and he has done so in an account so well-written that it is hard to put down. An absolutely indispensable read for anyone hoping to understand the evolution of one of the most beguiling and romantic figures of the modern age.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Scott Anderson, author of <i>Lawrence in Arabia: War, Deceit, Imperial Folly and the Making of the Modern Middle East</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;I enjoyed <em>The Young T. E. Lawrence</em> very much. On the subject of biography, Ulysses S. Grant once wrote that 'What I want to know is what a man did as a boy,' i.e., 'the formative years,' and while Lawrence is not a boy in Anthony Sattin&#x2019;s splendid book, he clearly prefigures Lawrence of Arabia&#x2015;a conscious striving toward becoming a hero, and a bold exploration not only of the Middle East but of himself.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Korda, author of <i>Hero: The Life and Legend of Lawrence of Arabia</i></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Anthony Sattin knows a good story when he sees one. While most of Lawrence's biographers focus heavily on the war period, Sattin has grasped the importance of the years Lawrence spent in the Middle East beforehand, essential preparation for what followed. As a travel writer enlarging on the writings of a forerunner, Sattin also often enriches Lawrence's account. I thoroughly enjoyed the result.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Jeremy Wilson, author of <i>Lawrence of Arabia: The Authorised Biography of T. E.

That&#x2019;s all I could think about. I wanted to be just like Cher.<br> <br>Every week, my parents and I gathered in the living room of our five-room apartment to watch The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour. I could barely wait until it was on each week. My father, Giacinto Gorga, sat on our green couch with my mother, Antonia, while I lay on the floor, right in front of the only TV set we had in the house at the time. It had a twelve-inch screen and dials to turn up the volume. We didn&#x2019;t have remotes back then and we only had thirteen channels or something.<br> <br>My brother, Giuseppe, who is two years younger than I am&#x2014;I call him Joey and he calls me Tre&#x2014;would only watch some of the programs with us, like Three&#x2019;s Company and Sanford and Son. He wasn&#x2019;t really into the ones where glamorous women in sequined gowns were singing and dancing onstage. He and I were best friends growing up. We rode bikes together, played board games and cards, and loved making forts in the living room with our blankets and pillows. He always had my back, and would kick me under the dinner table to warn me if I was pushing my dad to the limit while asking his permission for something. My parents and brother were my world growing up, and believe me, I could not have asked God for a better family.<br> <br>Watching Cher onstage took me to a whole other world. She was so glamorous in her long, slinky gowns, with her glittery diamond earrings. I loved her gorgeous makeup, perma-tan, and those loooong eyelashes. (Which I started wearing All. The. Time. on the show&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) I thought her huge fame, her undeniable glamour, and her devoted fans (I was, of course, one of them, though I never met her or anyone famous when I was little) were so amazing. As I lay there on the floor of my family&#x2019;s humble little apartment, fantasizing about what it would like to be Cher, I had no idea that one day I would be famous, too. But like Cher and every celebrity out there, I would come to see that fame comes with some of the best things in the world&#x2014;and some things that threaten to break you.<br> <br>I wanted to sing and dance like Cher. I thought I was pretty good at it. As a kid, I would put on little shows for my parents all the time in our living room, singing and dancing and pretending I was onstage. As I got older, I wished that my mom had sent me to dancing school or gymnastics class, but she didn&#x2019;t because she literally couldn&#x2019;t take me. She didn&#x2019;t start driving until I was in third grade, when she surprised all of us by getting her license! All on her own! We were all so proud of her. But up until then, when I was seven years old or so, she, Joey and I would walk everywhere, unless our dad drove us. They didn&#x2019;t trust anyone else to drive us anywhere because they were so protective.<br> <br>The bigger issue was that as an Italian immigrant, my mom simply didn&#x2019;t know how to go about finding classes for me and signing me up, even when she did have her license. My mom has since said that she would have taken me to dance or gymnastics if she&#x2019;d known I wanted to go. But I knew how hard it was for her to get around, even with a car, so I never asked her about it. I didn&#x2019;t want to burden her with that.<br> <br>Back then, my parents really didn&#x2019;t see the point of after-school activities, either. They were like, &#x201c;You have to be home for dinner at five-thirty. No out and about.&#x201d; So I would just take part in whatever activities were offered at school. I was a baton twirler in third grade, played softball in elementary school and in junior high, and played the saxophone in the seventh-grade and eighth-grade band. I gave up on my dream of becoming famous when I became a teenager because I thought it was just hopeless, to be honest. My parents had no Hollywood connections and no idea how to even begin to get me into showbiz. But still, I always wanted to become successful and make something of myself one day. I just didn&#x2019;t know what that would be.<br> <br>While I love the life my parents gave me and Joey, they definitely didn&#x2019;t have it easy when they came to America. They had a good life in Italy. There, they were surrounded by family and friends everywhere they turned, because Sala Consilina, the town where they grew up, is so tiny. Everyone looked out for everyone else. They were happy there, for sure, but wanted more than what their little hamlet offered. They left the only place they knew because they thought their children would have a better life in America, where anything was possible. Sala Consilina was beautiful but limited in opportunity, and I could not be more grateful for the life and the love they have given me. I had an amazing childhood, thanks to my parents&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but in order for me to have that incredible childhood, my parents sacrificed a lot.<br> <br>My dad, Giacinto, came here first, in the late sixties. He moved in with his sister in Paterson, New Jersey, a small city with lots of tall buildings, row houses, and concrete. It was a far cry from Sala Consilina, a small, medieval-looking town nestled in the rolling green and brown hills of the province of Salerno, about two hours from Naples. When I was little, I could always point to where it was on a map because it&#x2019;s right at the beginning of the boot in the southwest of Italy.<br> <br>My mom, Antonia, grew up as an only child and learned about heartbreak at an early age. She had a sister named Carmela, who passed away when she was fifteen days old. Her mother&#x2019;s (my grandmother&#x2019;s) name was Rosa, but everyone called her Teresa, which is pronounced Tare-ray-za. That&#x2019;s really how you say my name in Italian, although everyone here calls me Ter-ee-sah. I am named after my maternal grandmother. In Italian families, the tradition is to name your children after your husband&#x2019;s parents. But since my mom lost her mother, my dad broke with tradition. He said to my mom, &#x201c;If we get married and have a daughter, I want to name her after your mother.&#x201d; It was so loving of my dad to say that. My dad&#x2019;s mom totally understood, which is another reason why my parents loved her so much.<br> <br>Speaking of pronunciations of names, people always ask me why I say my last name different ways. Sometimes I pronounce it Joo-dee-chay or Joo-dih-chay, which is the Italian way to say my husband&#x2019;s last name, which ironically means &#x201c;judge&#x201d; in Italian. Other times I will say my last name is Joo-dice, which is the American way to say it. Most people have a hard time pronouncing it the Italian way, so I am sticking with the American way from now on. My husband is fine with that. We had used the Italian pronunciation to make Joe&#x2019;s dad happy, God rest his soul.<br> <br>While I can easily pronounce words in Italian, people would always laugh when I mixed up or mispronounced words on the show&#x2014;like when I called a nor&#x2019;easter a Norwegian, said the word ingrediences (!), stanima instead of stamina, and semolina instead of salmonella. I&#x2019;ve read stories that say I am known for my &#x201c;mixed metaphors and malapropisms.&#x201d; Mala&#x2014;what? Oh my God. I have no friggin&#x2019; idea how the heck to even begin to pronounce that one! What can I say? (That&#x2019;s why I had someone help me write this book!) People can laugh all they want. I grew up in a house where my parents spoke Italian all the time, so I spoke two languages, which is why I mix things up sometimes. (I still speak Italian with my parents today&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.) I am blowing all of the haters a big kiss right now. I don&#x2019;t want to hate. I just want to love, love, love, love! But look&#x2014;it is what it is. And now I definitely know the difference between a nor&#x2019;easter and a Norwegian&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, sort of.<br> <br>When my mom was a baby, my grandfather, whose name was Pietro, told my grandmother that he was going to leave Sala Consilina for Venezuela to work&#x2014;and never returned. No one knew if he never returned by choice, or if he was forced to stay. They didn&#x2019;t even know if he was alive or dead. My mother doesn&#x2019;t remember meeting him because he left when she was so young. To this day, my family doesn&#x2019;t know what happened to him. As the years went on, my grandmother tried to find him. She tried to write to him, but wasn&#x2019;t even sure he got the letters. He never answered. That broke their hearts.<br> <br>After her father (my grandfather) left, my mom and her mother (my grandmother) went to live with my grandmother&#x2019;s parents (my great-grandparents), Rosa and Vincenzo. But my grandmother led a very lonely life. She never left the house, for fear that people would shun her and talk about her because she had no husband. That&#x2019;s how it was back then. She came from a respectable family but felt ashamed that her husband had left, even though she didn&#x2019;t do anything wrong. So she never went out with friends, to the many feasts they held in town (it&#x2019;s the Italian way!), or even to church. She would just stay home and work the land with my great-grandfather and help my great-grandmother cook, sew, make sausages, jar vegetables, and take care of my mom, of course.<br> <br>Things only got worse for my mom and grandmother as my mom got older. When my mom was nine, my grandmother got very sick. She started to lose a lot of weight and always seemed to have a cold and a cough, so her family took her to see a doctor in Naples. By then it was too late. They told her she was very sick, possibly with lung cancer. They sent her home and she died months later. My mom was an orphan at only ten years old. She was devastated. She and her mother did everything together and were incredibly close. She still had her grandparents, who loved her so much, but said she felt so alone in the world without her mother by her side. Every girl needs her mother, and my mom felt so lost without hers. I can&#x2019;t even imagine what she went through. That&#x2019;s what made it so hard for me to be away from my own girls when I went to prison. They needed their mother, too, even if I was only gone for eleven and a half months.<br> <br>But that wasn&#x2019;t the end of my mother&#x2019;s pain. While she was still reeling from my grandmother&#x2019;s death, my great-grandfather died a month later because he was so heartbroken over losing his daughter. My mother loved my great-grandfather so much because he was the only father figure she ever had. All of this death and sorrow was a lot for a little girl to take. It was a very dark time for my mother. Again, I cannot even fathom what she went through.<br> <br>But she went on to have a happy life, thank God. My great-grandmother continued to raise her. She had so much strength and was so good to my mother. Since it was just the two of them, my mom had to learn how to do everything around the house, from cooking and making sausages, to tending the garden and making clothes, just like my grandmother did. That&#x2019;s how she learned to be such an amazing cook and to take care of Joey, my dad, and me so well. What I admire so much about my mom is that while her childhood was filled with such trauma and sadness, she was never bitter or angry over everything that had happened to her. Despite everything she went through, she is one of the kindest people I have ever met. She has a heart of gold (and not one bad bone in her body). She is sweet and loving&#x2014;and laughs a lot. Even today. I love her so much and am so blessed to have her as my mom.<br> <br>My dad grew up with his parents, Rosa (yes, another Rosa!) and Giuseppe (whom my brother is named after), two older brothers, Michael and Mario, and two older sisters, Antoinetta and Maria. My dad was the youngest in his family, like Audriana. There was also a brother named Nicola, which means Nicholas in English, who died at six.<br> <br>They lived in a three-story house made of stone, in the oldest part of Sala Consilina near the main piazza. Underneath the house, which you got to by climbing up a huge flight of stone stairs, were stalls and troughs for the goats, sheep, and pigs they used to keep. They had a huge yard, filled with beautiful fig and cypress trees and an impressive garden, because almost everyone grew their own vegetables. Joe and I visited the house in the show&#x2019;s second season. That was my favorite episode of all time. I was so happy to go back to Sala Consilina to see the relatives that Joe and I have there, since his family is from the same town. It&#x2019;s so beautiful and peaceful there. Most of the people there may not have five-carat diamonds, Chanel bags, McMansions, Ferraris, or yachts, but they are happy. Very happy. Because family is really all you need in this life.<br> <br>My dad met my mom when he was twenty and she was just thirteen, when she was on her way to a feast to celebrate the Blessed Virgin. My mother didn&#x2019;t give him a second thought, but my father couldn&#x2019;t get her out of his mind. He found out where she lived and began visiting her at her grandmother&#x2019;s house every week, as long as someone else was there, of course. (Italians were very strict back then and still were when I was growing up!) My dad wanted to propose right away, but his father told him he was too young and needed to have a good job and earn some money before he could get married and start a family. But her family wanted them to either get married or break up, because they didn&#x2019;t like the idea of a boy coming around if he wasn&#x2019;t planning to stay forever. So they broke up, but he never forgot about her. (This is my favorite part! It&#x2019;s so romantic!) Five years later, when he was working in America, he wrote to her, telling her that he still wanted to be with her and asked if she wanted to be with him. She replied, &#x201c;If you are serious, then come back to Italy so we can discuss it.&#x201d; He came right back to Italy and married her eighty-seven days later, on December 27, 1969.<br> <br>I love looking at their wedding album, which reminds me of scenes from The Godfather. After my parents exchanged vows in the church, they walked to the reception hall, with dozens of their friends and family following them in the streets&#x2014;just like in the movie. They have been married for forty-six years now and are still so in love. They still flirt and make each other laugh every day. They both have a great sense of humor&#x2014;which is where I get it from!<br> <br>After my parents got married, they decided to come to America in 1971, with just two suitcases. My mom was pregnant with me when they moved to Paterson (but she didn&#x2019;t know it). Before my mom got here, she said she thought America was paradise. She had seen pictures and fell in love. She said she wanted to explore the world, since she had never set foot outside Sala Consilina in her life. But my dad kept saying to her, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ll really like it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>He was right. Living in a new country was very hard for both of them. Neither spoke English. My mom told me she would cry herself to sleep at night, wondering why they had left Italy. She would say, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have nobody here&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I don&#x2019;t understand what people are saying. This is terrible&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t even know how the money worked, but she said nice people at stores would help her count out her change&#x2014;and that no one ever stole from her. Yes, it was hard, but they had wanted to come to America&#x2014;the land of opportunity.<br> <br>My dad needed a job and began working as a dishwasher at an Italian restaurant, but he learned h...</p><h2>The Sweetest Song: The Song of Solomon Expressed Through the Lives of Saints and Martyrs</h2><p>Very good condition on the paperback book; looks like never been used; pages are clean; binding is tight; the spine is intact without creases; excellent condition on the cover; 223 pages; 1993 edition; published by Living Sacrifice Book Company (J-13)</p><p></p><h2>Empowering Women: Every Woman&#39;s Guide to Successful Living</h2><p>Offers insights on how women of all ages and backgrounds can achieve self-assurance and a valuable place in society</p><p></p><h2>The Land Where Lemons Grow: The Story Of Italy And Its Citrus Fruit</h2><p>Travellers have always been thrilled by the sight of citrus in Italy, where dark leaves and bright fruit seem to charge the landscape, making the trees symbols of a sun-soaked, poetic vision of the country.

She maps the citron&#39;s long migration from the foothills of the Himalayas to the shores of southern Italy, traces the bitter juice of Seville oranges through ancient Roman and Renaissance cookery books, exposes early manifestations of the Mafia during the nineteenth-century citrus boom, and laments the loss of landscapes shaped by citrus cultivation. The book is a celebration of the unique qualities of Italy&#39;s citrus fruit, from bergamot that will thrive only on a short stretch of coastline, to Calabria&#39;s Diamante citrons, vital to Jews all over the world during the celebration of Sukkoth. The Land Where Lemons Grow is a heady mixture of travel writing, history, horticulture and art; a unique journey through Italy&#39;s cultural, culinary and political past. Helena Attlee is the author of four books about Italian gardens, and others on the cultural history of gardens around the world.

Helena is a Fellow of the Royal Literary Fund and has worked in Italy for nearly 30 years.Thrillingly sensual, and zesty in every sense, Helena Attlee is the best of companions as she leads us through sundrenched citrus groves and in and out of history. A book full of surprises, with many curiosities, stories and recipes on the way -- Deborah Moggach, author of The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel Inspired and inspiring, in prose as sharp as the fruit it celebrates -- David Wheeler, editor of Hortus This is the first among my books of the year. Every page of Attlee&#39;s subtle fusion of history and horticulture made me feel that it&#39;s time to pack the bags again for Italy -- Jonathan Keates * Literary Review * 4 stars. Attlee, who knows and loves Italy and the Italians, takes the reader through the country&#39;s scented gardens with her sharp descriptions, pertinent stories and quotes and intriguing recipes. I was there with her -- Anna del Conte * Sunday Telegraph * Fascinating . . . A distinguished garden writer, Attlee fell under the spell of citrus over ten years ago and the book, like the eleventh labour of Hercules to steal the golden fruit of the Hesperides, is the result. She writes with great lucidity, charm and gentle humour, and wears her considerable learning lightly . . . Helena Attlee&#39;s elegant, absorbing prose and sure-footed ability to combine the academic with the anecdotal, make The Land Where Lemons Grow a welcome addition to the library of citrologists and Italophiles alike * The Times Literary Supplement * A paradise of citrus is how I always think of Italy too: a place where ice-cold limoncello is sipped from tiny glasses on piazzas, and everything from ricotta cake to osso bucco is enlivened with zest. What a joy, therefore, to read Helena Attlee&#39;s The Land Where Lemons Grow, which tells the story of Italy through its citrus fruit -- Bee Wilson * Telegraph * Truly fascinating . . . For many years, Attlee has been collecting evidence for a story of citrus trees in Italy. The result, The Land Where Lemons Grow, is remarkable, excellently produced and essential for all lovers of Italy, their summer libraries and out-of-season itineraries . . . Attlee&#39;s book is unmissable for anyone intrigued by the relation between humans&#39; travel, greed and ingenuity and the spread of the plants that we eat, smell and drink -- Robin Lane Fox * Financial Times * &#39;It would be a treat to find The Land Where Lemons Grow under the tree&#39; -- Carolyn Hart * Telegraph, Books of the Year * &#39;It turned out to be the book I pressed on friends more than any other this year. If they were bemused, I hope they remained to be charmed. I read it randomly a few pages at a time until there were no pages I hadn&#39;t read twice. It was my respite from purposive reading.&#39; -- Tom Stoppard * TLS, Books of the Year *</p><h2>The Player: A Carter Ross Mystery (Carter Ross Mysteries, 5)</h2><p><p>When he hears residents of a Newark neighborhood are getting sick&#x2015;and even dying&#x2015;from a strange disease, investigative reporter Carter Ross dives into the story&#x2015;so deep he comes down with the illness himself. With even more motivation to track down the source of the disease, Carter soon hits upon a nearby construction site. But when the project's developer is found dead, and his mob ties surface, Carter knows he's looking at a story much bigger&#x2015;and with even more dangerous consequences&#x2015;than an environmental hazard.</p><p>Back in the newsroom, Carter has his hands full with his current girlfriend and with the paper's newest eager intern, not to mention his boss and former girlfriend Tina Thompson, who has some news for Carter that's about to make tangling with the mob seem simple by comparison, in <i>The Player </i>by Brad Parks.</p></p><p>BRAD PARKS is the only author to have won the Shamus, Nero and Lefty Awards, three of crime fiction's most prestigious prizes. A former reporter for <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>The</i> (Newark, N.J.) <i>Star-Ledger</i>, <i>The Player</i> is his fifth novel. He lives in Virginia with his wife and two small children.CHAPTER 1 <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Even in an era when American print media has plunged into inexorable and perhaps terminal decline, even at a time when tech moguls are buying up venerated news-gathering organizations with their equivalent of couch change, even with the likelihood of career advancement dimmed by the industry&#x2019;s collective implosion, there are benefits to working for a newspaper that cannot be quantified by simple measurements like salary, benefits, or future prospects. <br>Kook calls are definitely one of them. <br>We get them all the time&#x2014;from the drunken, the deranged, the demented&#x2014;and they come in enough different flavors to keep us constantly entertained. <br>Some are just mild, low-grade kooks, like the ones who have newspapers confused with talk radio. They&#x2019;ll call up and start ranting about whatever subject is bothering them&#x2014;the governor&#x2019;s latest cabinet appointment, the confusing signage that led them down the wrong exit ramp of the Garden State Parkway, the deplorable slowness of third-class mail&#x2014;perhaps believing that if they just convince the reporter they&#x2019;re right, the newspaper will immediately launch a four-part series on the subject, written from the caller&#x2019;s particular point of view. <br>Then there are the conspiracy theorists, the ones who want us to &#x201c;do some digging&#x201d; into whatever fantasies they&#x2019;re harboring at the moment, whether it&#x2019;s that the local Walmart is importing illegal immigrants from Bangladesh in a garbage truck or that their town&#x2019;s animal-control officer is more of a dog person than a cat person. <br>There are also the old people who just want to talk. To someone. About anything. They&#x2019;ll call up with a &#x201c;news tip,&#x201d; and of course it turns out they are the news, and the tip is that long ago&#x2014;during, say, the Korean War&#x2014;they nearly lost three toes to frostbite. And now, particularly on the mornings when they still feel that little tingle in their big toes, they feel the world at large needs to know about it. <br>Then there are the other standbys: the prisoners who use their phone time to call us, usually collect, and convince us of the gross miscarriage of justice that led to their incarceration; the paranoid schizophrenics who believe their delusions are worthy of front-page headlines; or the poor confused souls who, thinking newspaper reporters must be omniscient, will call and ask the name of the program they were watching on television last night. <br>As a group, they land somewhere between pitiable&#x2014;particularly when they&#x2019;re obviously suffering from mental illness&#x2014;and laughable. Except for the racists. We get a lot of those, too. They&#x2019;re just despicable. <br>Sure, Internet chat rooms and social networking have siphoned off some of our kooks over the years&#x2014;there are more outlets for people to express their crazy now than ever before&#x2014;but we at the <i>Newark Eagle-Examiner,</i> New Jersey&#x2019;s most widely circulated periodical, still get our share. Because the fact is, even with the increasing fragmentation of media, most people, even the nuts, realize a major daily newspaper like ours is still the best way to get serious attention for whatever cause or issue matters most to them. <br>Plus, we print our phone number in the paper. <br>Some reporters treat kook calls as nuisances. But most of us learn over the years to look forward to them. There&#x2019;s just nothing like going through an otherwise ordinary day, pecking away at some humdrum story, when suddenly you become aware one of your colleagues is talking to someone who lives off the grid and has found one of the three remaining working pay phones in the state of New Jersey to call and explicate his worldview. <br>If the reporter who takes the call is in a certain mood, she&#x2019;ll stand up in the middle of the newsroom and, for the benefit of those listening, start repeating key lines and questions in a loud voice, such as: &#x201c;I realize you think Greta Van Susteren is trying to control your mind, but that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean Wolf Blitzer is going to try as well.&#x201d; <br>Or: &#x201c;So you want to know if we&#x2019;re going to be writing about the rash of robberies in your neighborhood because someone keeps breaking into your house and moving your broom.&#x201d; <br>Or: &#x201c;To make sure I understand this right, you&#x2019;re saying the Battle of Gettysburg didn&#x2019;t happen the way the history books said it did&#x2014;and you know, because you were there in a previous life?&#x201d; <br>The fun just never ends. So I have to admit I was mostly just looking for a good kook call on Monday afternoon when one of our news clerks wandered over to my desk and said, &#x201c;Hey, I got a woman who says she has a big story for our investigative reporter. You want me to get rid of her?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nah, I&#x2019;ll take it,&#x201d; I said. <br>I had just been killing time anyway, waiting for edits on my latest piece, a story about cash-strapped municipalities that were considering halting their recycling programs (corrugated waste products have seldom warranted so much attention). So when the forwarded call came through on my desk phone, I rubbed my hands together in anticipation, then answered with my most polite and officious, &#x201c; <i>Eagle-Examiner</i>, this is Carter Ross.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Hi, Mr. Ross, my name is Jackie Orr,&#x201d; came the voice on the other end. It was the voice of someone young, black, and determined. <br>&#x201c;Hi, Jackie, what can I do for you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Do you ever do stories about people getting sick?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;That depends,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Who&#x2019;s getting sick?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Everyone.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;What do you mean &#x2018;everyone&#x2019;?&#x201d; I asked. So far, so good: kooks often insisted that whatever troubled them also afflicted others. <br>&#x201c;Well, first it was just my grandmother. Or we thought it was just my grandmother. But then it turned out to be the whole neighborhood.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Sounds like you need a lawyer more than you need a newspaper reporter,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;I tried that. I tell them people are sick and they&#x2019;re interested. But once they hear it&#x2019;s not some open-and-shut mesothelioma case, they don&#x2019;t want anything to do with it. I talked to one lawyer who sounded a little interested, but then he wanted a fifty-thousand-dollar retainer. If we had fifty thousand dollars, we wouldn&#x2019;t be bothering with lawsuits. We&#x2019;d just move. Our case is a little more complicated than anyone seems to want to take on.&#x201d; <br>I felt myself sitting up in my chair and paying closer attention. There are certain words kooks tend not to use. &#x201c;Mesothelioma&#x201d; is one of them. So while that was a little disappointing&#x2014;no kook call for me today&#x2014;it was also more promising from a journalistic standpoint. As a newspaper reporter, I have a certain bias toward the disenfranchised, disadvantaged masses that others, not even sleazy lawyers, want to listen to. Maybe it&#x2019;s because, deep down, I fancy myself a good-hearted human being who wants to help the less fortunate. Or maybe it&#x2019;s because the Pulitzer committee shares the same bias. <br>&#x201c;You said it&#x2019;s complicated. How so?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, we don&#x2019;t know what&#x2019;s making anyone sick.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Okay, so you don&#x2019;t need a lawyer. You need a doctor.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Everyone is seeing doctors. Or at least the ones who have health insurance are. The doctors just treat the symptoms and send them home. They don&#x2019;t have any answers.&#x201d; <br>I didn&#x2019;t either. But I was intrigued enough to have Jackie assemble herself and some of her ill neighbors to chat with me that afternoon. The headline MYSTERY ILLNESS STRIKES NEWARK NEIGHBORHOOD had a lot more promise for interesting journalism than MORRISTOWN WEIGHS COSTS AND BENEFITS OF RECYCLING NO. 6 PLASTIC. <br>Besides, as a reporter, I had learned to trust that little assignment editor in my head to tell me when I might be onto a good story. And my assignment editor was telling me, at the very least, that Jackie Orr was no kook. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Having gained a modest amount of seniority at the <i>Eagle-Examiner</i>&#x2014;eight years counted as senior at a newspaper where most of the older reporters had been forced to take buyouts&#x2014;I had wrangled myself a prime desk location in the corner of the newsroom. <br>It was strategic, inasmuch as it meant editors couldn&#x2019;t sneak up on me. But more than that, it was panoramic, inasmuch as it afforded me a sweeping view of the magnificent and picturesque vista that was a daily newspaper in action. In a single glance, I could see the anguish of the photo editors who had eleven assignments to shoot and only four photographers to do the shooting; the boredom of the Web site writers who were still repurposing yesterday&#x2019;s news until today gave them something interesting to do; the torment of the education reporter trying to make a story about teacher-pension reform sound interesting. And, okay, maybe it didn&#x2019;t fit conventional standards for beauty&#x2014;unless you found splendor in forty-year-old office furniture and fifteen-year-old computer terminals&#x2014;but it was my view and I loved it all the same. <br>Along the walls were the glass offices, home to the higher editors who sometimes conspired to limit my fun but were otherwise a decent group, albeit sometimes in a cheerless, party-pooping, adjective-hating kind of way. <br>In the middle were the desks filled with reporters. There were a few duds among them, too, but by and large they were a magnificently contemptuous set of brilliant, irreverent, fascinating folks, the kind of people who almost always had interesting things to say and entertaining ways of saying it. And in a strange way I could never quite explain to outsiders&#x2014;who didn&#x2019;t necessarily understand how the cruciblelike forge of putting out a daily newspaper could bond people&#x2014;I considered them my extended, mildly dysfunctional family. <br>Just beyond them was an area of the room known as the intern pod. If kook calls were one of the immeasurable benefits of life at a newspaper, the joy of working with interns was more quantifiable. Through the years, the newspaper industry had come to rely on an ever-growing collection of young, idealistic, energetic, just-out-of-college flunkies to do much of the news gathering that used to be done by more-hardened souls. And while you had to be careful not to let some of their na�vet� get in the paper, they were fun all the same. At the age of thirty-two, I wasn&#x2019;t exactly Father Time. But I had been in the game just long enough that I knew there was a value to seeing the world through the nonjaded eyes of an intern. It helped keep me young. <br>Some of our interns, like Tommy Hernandez, now our city hall reporter and one of my best friends at the paper, started in this lowly post and quickly graduated to more important beats at the paper. Others had come and gone, leaving only their colorful nicknames&#x2014;Sweet Thang, Lunky, Ruthie&#x2014;and a smattering of stories in the archives by which we could remember them. <br>They were, most of all, cheap labor and eager helpmates. So it was that my eyes wandered toward the intern pod, looking for an enthusiastic aide-de-camp. Jackie Orr had promised me a room full of sick people. Interviewing them one by one, which is what I&#x2019;d need to do, would take time. Having the assistance of an intern, presuming it was one who had been properly potty trained, would double my efficiency and halve my time. Plus, much like with kook calls, there was always the entertainment factor to consider. Interns were nothing if not amusing. <br>This being the middle of the afternoon, the pod was only partially populated. Half of them were out being good little interns, chasing stories. As I sized up the half that remained, my gaze immediately fell on Neesha Krishnamurthy, a smart&#x2014;if a little too smart&#x2014;young woman who had come to us from somewhere in the Ivy League. Columbia School of Journalism, if memory served. Poor thing. <br>Neesha&#x2019;s internship had thus far been distinguished only by an incident during the early days of her employment, when she stumbled across one of those only-in-Newark stories: a one-legged homeless man who had taken on a one-legged pigeon as a pet, training the bird to perch on his finger, arm, and shoulder. <br>Neesha somehow persuaded her editor to let her write a human-interest story about the guy&#x2014;some kind of misguided effort to tug on the readership&#x2019;s heartstrings with a tale of man and bird, bonded by their shared disability. Unfortunately for her, our Web editors thought it had what they liked to call &#x201c;viral potential,&#x201d; so they sent along a videographer. And he had the camera rolling during that priceless moment when Neesha got the bird on her shoulder and it confused her for its favorite statue, depositing a salvo of white glop on her arm. <br>One point three million YouTube hits had guaranteed that, for the rest of her days at the <i>Eagle-Examiner,</i> Neesha would be known as Pigeon. <br>Hence, I strolled over to the intern pod, sat down across from her, and said, &#x201c;Hey, Pigeon, what&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; <br>She looked stricken. &#x201c;How long are people going to keep calling me that? <br>&#x201c;Well, that all depends on one thing,&#x201d; I said, faux philosophically. <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How long you plan on being alive.&#x201d; <br>She groaned. &#x201c;What if I become executive editor someday? That would mean people would have to stop calling me Pigeon, right?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;No, that would mean we&#x2019;d have to stop calling you Pigeon to your face.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s so unfair!&#x201d; she whined. <br>&#x201c;No, unfair is being a pigeon in Newark, New Jersey with only one leg. What happened to you is just funny.&#x201d; <br>She pouted. Pigeon could be considered attractive&#x2014;lots of long, dark hair and long, dark eyelashes surrounded by rather flawless skin&#x2014;but after a dalliance with the aforementioned Sweet Thang, I had promised myself to swear off interns. Plus, I had enough complications in my romantic life at the moment. <br>&#x201c;Anyhow, I was wondering if you wanted to help me report a story,&#x201d; I said. <br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t involve pigeons, does it? Because Buster Hays tried to trick me into a story about a&#x2014;&#x201d; <br>I interrupted her by laughing. Buster Hays was the oldest reporter left, the only septuagenarian in a newsroom whose median age was roughly twenty-four. He hung around mostly because he was far too cantankerous to give us the pleasure of seeing him quit. <br>&#x201c;No, no. I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; I assured her. &#x201c;No pigeons. No birds of any sort. I got a tip about a neighborhood in Newark where apparently a bunch of people are getting sick and no one knows why.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, cool,&#x201d; she said. <br>Yes, this was one who belonged in the Fourth Estate: only someone with a reporter&#x2019;s sensibilities would describe mysteriously ill people as &#x201c;cool.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Anyhow, there&#x2019;s going to be a group of them gathered at a house this afternoon, and I was hoping you could help me interview them. You busy?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Well, sort of. But it can wait. Let me just go tell Matt where I&#x2019;m going.&#x201d; <br>Matt was her editor. And he was a decent enough guy, for an editor, but I didn&#x2019;t need Matt knowing about this. There was too great a risk he would tell my editor, Tina Thompson, with whom I had a somewhat complex relationship. The less Tina knew about my activities at the moment, the better. <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t do that,&#x201d; I said. She looked confused, so I continued: &#x201c;Intern lesson number one: when it comes to editors, it&#x2019;s always better to beg forgiveness than ask permission.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d; she asked. <br>&#x201c;Well, that depends. Do you want to be known around here for something other than bird poop?&#x201d; <br>She followed me out of the newsroom without another word. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>The address furnished to me by Jackie Orr was on Ridgewood Avenue, and as we made the short drive out there from downtown, I gave Pigeon a quick history lesson. Ridgewood Avenue used to be one of the South Ward&#x2019;s great streets, located in the Weequahic section of the city, one of Newark&#x2019;s great neighborhoods. Then someone got the fine idea to construct Interstate 78 ...</p><h2>Dragon</h2><p><p> Japan, 1945: Two U.S. bombers take off with atomic bombs.

After a disastrous early marriage, Brooke Astor wedded the notoriously ill-tempered Vincent Astor, who died in 1959. In a highly publicized courtroom battle, Brooke fought off an attempt to break Vincent's will, which left some $67 million to the Vincent Astor Foundation. As the foundation's president, Brooke would use this legacy to benefit New York, where the Astor fortune had been made.<br><br> Brooke would personally visit each grant applicant and charm anyone she met. At her one-hundredth birthday, princes and presidents honored her, but in 2006 a grandson petitioned the courts to have his father removed as Brooke's guardian. Once again an Astor court battle became the stuff of headlines. This biography&#x2015;based on firsthand knowledge and interviews with Brooke's friends and the heads of New York's great cultural institutions&#x2015;gives us back the woman so loved and admired, whose hands-on approach would inspire future philanthropists. 16 pages of photographs</p><p>A former editor at The New Yorker, Frances Kiernan is the author of The Last Mrs. Astor: A New York Story and Seeing Mary Plain: A Life of Mary McCarthy. She lives in New York City.Until last summer's reports that Brooke Astor's son was keeping her on a shoestring budget in her Manhattan apartment, the widow of millionaire Vincent Astor was known as a society maven who doled out money to worthy causes. But in this enjoyable and flattering biography, former <i>New Yorker</i> editor Kiernan, who knows Mrs. Astor personally, describes how the thrice-married woman was raised to be charming and agreeable, and learned her lessons well. Kiernan finds some detractors, who saw Astor's charm as manipulative and her agreeable nature as sugarcoating on a single-minded determination to advance her status. But even the negative comments have a positive spin. Responding to the theory that Astor married the ill-tempered and reclusive Vincent for money, Louis Auchincloss said, "I wouldn't respect her if she hadn't. Only a twisted person would have married him for love." Then again, it was an odd pairing, and not just because the matchmaker was Vincent's then-second wife, who allegedly wanted out and believed the way to obtain a generous settlement was to find "a suitable replacement." Tidbits like these add zip to Kiernan's affectionate portrait of the poet and writer who really made her mark when she took over her husband's philanthropic foundation. A portrait of the grande dame in decline, manipulated by her son is a poignant end to a grand saga. 16 pages of photos. <i>(May 21)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Starting with village riots in the Essex countryside, chaos rapidly spread across much of the south-east of England, as tens of thousands of ordinary men and women marched in fury to London, torching houses, slaughtering their social superiors and terrifying the life out of those who got in their way. The burning down of Savoy Palace, home to the most powerful magnate in the realm, marked one of the Revolt&#39;s most violent episodes.The Peasants&#39; Revolt has remained an underexplored period of history. In revisiting the bloody events of 1381, Dan Jones has brought back to glorious life the squalor, drama and complex hierarchies of a society that until now seemed almost too distant to imagine. His examination of village life and the failings of government from the perspective of the Revolt&#39;s key players is both intellectually stimulating and compulsively readable.Vivid, atmospheric and beautifully written, this is historical writing of the highest quality.</p><p>Dan Jones took a first in History from Pembroke College, Cambridge in 2002.

In a span of more than six decades, Mailer has searched into subjects ranging from World War II to Ancient Egypt, from the march on the Pentagon to Marilyn Monroe, from Henry Miller and Mohammad Ali to Jesus Christ. Now, in <i>The Castle in the Forest,</i> his first major work of fiction in more than a decade, Mailer offers what may be his consummate literary endeavor: He has set out to explore the evil of Adolf Hitler. <br><br>The narrator, a mysterious SS man who is later revealed to be an exceptional presence, gives us young Adolf from birth, as well as Hitler&#x2019;s father and mother, his sisters and brothers, and the intimate details of his childhood and adolescence.<br><br>A tapestry of unforgettable characters, <i>The Castle in the Forest</i> delivers its playful twists and surprises with astonishing insight into the nature of the struggle between good and evil that exists in us all. At its core is a hypothesis that propels this novel and makes it a work of stunning originality. Now, on the eve of his eighty-fourth birthday, Norman Mailer may well be saying more than he ever has before.</p><p>Norman Mailer was born in 1923 in Long Branch, New Jersey, and grew up in Brooklyn, New York. In 1955, he was one of the co-founders of The Village Voice. He is the author of more than thirty books, including <i>The Naked and the Dead;</i> <i>The Armies of the Night</i>, for which he won a National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize; <i>The Executioner&#x2019;s Song</i>, for which he won his second Pulitzer Prize; <i>Harlot&#x2019;s Ghost</i>; <i>Oswald&#x2019;s Tale</i>; and <i>The Gospel According to the Son</i>. Mr. Mailer passed away Saturday November 10th, 2007.1<br><br>You may call me D.T. That is short for Dieter, a German name, and D.T. will do, now that I am in America, this curious nation. If I draw upon reserves of patience, it is because time passes here without meaning for me, and that is a state to dispose one to rebellion. Can this be why I am writing a book? Among my former associates, we had to swear never to undertake such an action. I was, after all, a member of a matchless Intelligence group. Its classification was SS, Special Section IV-2a, and we were directly under the supervision of Heinrich Himmler. Today, the man is seen as a monster, and I would not look to defend him&#x2014;he turned out to be one hell of a monster. All the same, Himmler did have an original mind, and one of his theses does take me into my literary intentions, which are, I promise, not routine.<br><br>2<br><br>The room that Himmler used when speaking to our elite group was a small lecture hall with dark walnut paneling and was limited to twenty seats raked upward in four rows of five. My emphasis will not be, however, on such descriptions. I prefer to concern myself with Himmler&#x2019;s unorthodox concepts. They may even have stimulated me to begin a memoir that is bound to prove unsettling. I know that I will sail into a sea of turbulence, for I must uproot many a conventional belief. A cacophony erupts in my spirit at the thought. As Intelligence officers, we often seek to warp our findings. Mendacity, after all, possesses its own art, but this is a venture that will ask me to forsake such skills.<br><br>Enough! Let me present Heinrich Himmler. You, the reader, must be prepared for no easy occasion. This man, whose nickname, behind his back, was Heini, had become by 1938 one of the four truly important leaders in Germany. Yet his most cherished and secret intellectual pursuit was the study of incest. It dominated our highest-level research, and our findings were kept to closed conferences. Incest, Heini would propose, had always been rife among the poor of all lands. Even our German peasantry had been much afflicted, yes, even as late as the nineteenth century. &#x201c;Normally, no one in learned circles cares to speak of the matter,&#x201d; he would remark. &#x201c;After all, there is nothing to be done. Who would bother to call some poor wretch a certified offspring of incest? No, every establishment of every civilized nation looks to sweep such stuff under the rug.&#x201d;<br><br>That is, all ranking government officials in the world except for our Heinrich Himmler. He did have the most extraordinary ideas fermenting behind his unhappy spectacles. I must repeat that for a man with a bland and chinless mug, he certainly exhibited a frustrating mixture of brilliance and stupidity. For example, he declared himself to be a pagan. He predicted that there would be a healthy future for humankind once paganism took over the world. Everyone&#x2019;s soul would then be enriched with hitherto unacceptable pleasures. None of us could conceive, however, of an orgy where carnality would rise to such a pitch that you might find a woman ready to throw herself into a flesh-melting roll with Heinrich Himmler. No, not even in the most innovative spirit! For you could always see his face as it must once have been at a school dance, that bespectacled disapproving stare of the wallflower, tall, thin, a youth full of physical ineptitude. Already he had a small potbelly. There he was, ready to wait by the wall while the dance went on.<br><br>Yet he grew obsessed over the years with matters others did not dare to mention aloud (which, I must say, is usually the first step to new thought). In fact, he paid close attention to mental retardation. Why? Because Himmler subscribed to the theory that the best human possibilities lie close to the worst. So he was ready to assume that promising children when found in low, nondescript families could be &#x201c;incestuaries.&#x201d; The word in German, as he coined it, was Inzestuarier. He did not like the more common term of such disgrace, Blutschande (blood-scandal), or as it is sometimes employed in polite circles, Dramatik des Blutes (blood-drama).<br><br>None of us felt sufficiently qualified to say that his theory could be dismissed. Even in the early years of the SS, Himmler had recognized that one of our prime needs was to develop exceptional research groups. We had a duty to search into ultimates. As Himmler put it, the health of National Socialism depended on nothing less than these letzte Fragen (last questions). We were to explore problems that other nations did not dare to go near. Incest was at the head of the list. The German mind had to re-establish itself again as the leading inspiration to the learned world. In turn&#x2014;so went his unstated coupling&#x2014;much recognition might be given to Heinrich Himmler for his profound attack on problems originating in the agricultural milieu. He would emphasize the underlying point: Husbandry could hardly be investigated without comprehending the peasant. Yet to understand this man of the earth was to speak of incest.<br><br>Here, I promise you, he would hold up his hand in precisely that little gesture Hitler used to employ&#x2014;one prissy flip of the wrist. It was Heinrich&#x2019;s way of saying: &#x201c;Now comes the meat. And with it&#x2014;the potatoes!&#x201d; Off he would go on a peroration. &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he would say, &#x201c;incest! This is one very good reason that old peasants are devout. An acute fear of the sinful is bound to display itself by one of two extremes: Absolute devotion to religious practice. Or nihilism. I can recall from my student days that the Marxist Friedrich Engels once wrote, &#x2018;When the Catholic Church decided adultery was impossible to prevent, they made divorce impossible to obtain.&#x2019; A brilliant remark even if it comes from the wrong mouth. As much can be said for blood-scandal. That is also impossible to prevent. So, the peasant looks to keep himself devout.&#x201d; He nodded. He nodded again as if two good pumps of his head might be the minimum necessary to convince us that he was speaking from both sides of his heart.<br><br>How often, he asked, could the average peasant of the last century avoid these blood temptations? After all, that was not so easy. Peasants, it had to be said, were not usually attractive people. Their features were worn away by hard labor. Besides, they reeked of the field and the barn. Personal odors were at the mercy of hot summers. Under such circumstances, would not basic impulses trigger forbidden inclinations? Given the paucity of their social life, how were they to acquire the ability to stay away from entanglements with brothers and sisters, fathers and daughters?<br><br>He did not go on to speak of the pell-mell of limbs and torsos formed by three or four children in a bed, nor the ham-handed naturalness of the most agreeable work of all&#x2014;that hard-breathing, feverish meat-heavy run up the hills of physical joy&#x2014;but he did declare, &#x201c;More than a few in the agricultural sector come, willy-nilly, to see incest as an acceptable option. Who, after all, is most likely to find the honorable work-hardened features of the father or the brother particularly attractive? The sisters, of course! Or the daughters. Often they are the only ones. The father, having created them, remains the focus of their attention.&#x201d;<br><br>Hand it to Himmler. He had been storing theories in his head for two decades. A great believer in Schopenhauer, he would also give prominence to a word still relatively new in 1938&#x2014;genes. These genes, he said, were the biological embodiment of Schopenhauer&#x2019;s concept of the Will. They are the basic element of this mysterious Will. &#x201c;We know,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;that instincts can be passed from one generation to the next. Why? I would say it is in the nature of the Will to remain true to its origins. I even speak of that as a Vision, yes, gentlemen, a force that lives at the core of our human existence. It is this Vision which separates us from the animals. From the beginning of our time on earth, we humans have been seeking to rise to the unseen heights that lie ahead.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course, there are impediments to such a great goal. The most exceptional of our genes must still be able to surmount the privations, humiliations, and tragedies of life as the genes are transmitted from father to child, generation after generation. Great leaders, I would tell you, are rarely the product of one father and one mother. It is more likely that the rare leader is the one who has succeeded in breaking through the bonds that held back ten frustrated generations who could not express the Vision in their own lives but did pass it on through their genes.<br><br>&#x201c;Needless to say, I have arrived at these concepts by meditat- ing upon the life of Adolf Hitler. His heroic rise resonates in our hearts. Since he issues, as we know, from a long line of modest peasant stock, his life demonstrates a superhuman achievement. Absolute awe must overwhelm us.&#x201d;<br><br>As Intelligence agents, we were smiling within. This had been the peroration. Now our Heinrich was ready to enter what Americans call the nitty-gritty. &#x201c;The real question to be asked,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;is how does the brilliance of the Vision protect itself from being dulled by commingling? That is implicit in the process of so-called normal reproduction. Contemplate the multimillions of sperm. One of them has to travel all the way up to the ovum of the female. To each lonely sperm cell swimming in the uterine sea, that ovum will loom as large as a battle cruiser.&#x201d; He paused before he nodded. &#x201c;The same readiness for self-sacrifice that will carry men at war through an uphill attack on a forbidding ridge must exist in healthy sperm. The essence of the male seed is that it is ready to commit itself to just such immolation in order that one of them, at least, will reach the ovum!&#x201d;<br><br>He stared at us. Could we share his excitement? &#x201c;The next question,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;soon arises. Will the genes of the woman be compatible with the ...</p><h2>Horsewatching: Why does a horse whinny and everything else you ever wanted to know</h2><p>The author of the phenomenally successful <b>Catwatching, Dogwatching,</b> and <b>Catlore</b> turns his attention to horses, answering more than 40 intriguing questions about the nature of the horse, and discussing the myths and history of horses through the ages. Desmond Morris delights animal lovers once again in this book of facts and lore. <b>25 black-and-white drawings.</b></p><p>Desmond Morris was born in 1928. Educated at Birmingham and Oxford universities, he became the Curator of Mammals at London Zoo in 1959, a post he held for eight years. In 1967 he published The Naked Ape which has sold over 10 million copies worldwide and has changed the way we view our own species forever. An accomplished artist, tv presenter, film maker and writer, Desmond Morris&#39;s books have been published in over thirty-six countries.Compared to The Naked Ape, the . . . Watching books (previous titles examined cats and dogs) are a step backwards for Morris. The title in hand offers questions and answers about the physiology and behavior of horses plus horse lore. Morris tells us that the horse's eye is one of the largest in the animal kingdom--bigger than the eye of the elephant or whale--and concludes that horses are nocturnal animals. On the subject of feeding, he notes that horses cannot vomit, that their natural feeding behavior is endless, varied grazing, that they are low-grade food specialists. There is material on cold-bloods, hot-bloods and breeds (207, of which 67 are ponies, 36 working horses, 104 sports horses). Discussing human-horse relationships, Morris states the secret of equine appeal is that the animal slaves for us while still looking noble.

One of six children of an upper-middle-class family, Jekyll traveled and studied to be an artist, but her poor eyesight and competing interests led her to crafts, photography, and gardens, and to develop theories of color, texture, design, flower arrangement, and breeding that she published in 15 books with such titles as Wood and Garden and Garden Ornament. Like Ruskin (her inspiration, whom she met while visiting her sister in Venice) and William Morris, Jekyll participated in the Arts and Crafts Movement, a reaction against industrial mass-production in favor of well-designed, handmade goods, especially pottery and needlework. Politically an elitist, personally an abrasive, autocratic, reclusive perfectionist, excessively sensitive to sound, she was affectionately known as ``Bumps,'' an awkward ``spinster'' who disliked children but inspired such loyalty that after her death her gardening boots went on a 20-year odyssey as friends tried to place them in major museums. Largely because of the great writings about it, the garden has come to serve a powerful metaphoric function in English life. While Jekyll may have been aware of the significance of her vocation, especially as a woman, Festing apparently is not. Instead of a cultural lineage, she offers social lineage and unfamiliar names- -Hercules Brabazon of Oaklands in Sedlescomb, or the Higford Burrs of Aldermaster Court, for instance, and of the ``imperishable memory'' of visiting ``Mr. Barr's Tooting nursery with Mrs. Bennet- Poe.'' With few illustrations of Jekyll's work (the 47 b&amp;w photographs are mostly of people) or quotations from her writings, it is difficult to tell what purpose this biography serves. -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

In this new intervention, Fredric Jameson&#x2014;perhaps the most influential and persuasive theorist of postmodernity&#x2014;excavates and explores these notions in a fresh and illuminating manner.<br><br>The extraordinary revival of discussions of modernity, as well as of new theories of artistic modernism, demands attention in its own right. It seems clear that the (provisional) disappearance of alternatives to capitalism plays its part in the universal attempt to revive &#x2018;modernity&#x2019; as a social ideal. Yet the paradoxes of the concept illustrate its legitimate history and suggest some rules for avoiding its misuse as well.<br><br>In this major new interpretation of the problematic, Jameson concludes that both concepts are tainted, but nonetheless yield clues as to the nature of the phenomena they purported to theorize. His judicious and vigilant probing of both terms&#x2014;which can probably not be banished at this late date&#x2014;helps us clarify our present political and artistic situations.</p><p><b>Jean Baudrillard</b> (1929&#x2013;2007) began teaching sociology at the Universit� de Paris-X in 1966.

It's an extraordinary place, but it is in danger of becoming ordinary because of the nefarious Blue Queen.

Young Fern is a royal Anybody, possessed of transformative powers. Her fellow Anybodies inhabit a city under Manhattan, but Fern lives aboveground with her aging grandmother, the Great Realdo, and her ineffectual Anybody father in a house made entirely of books and also inhabited by hobbits and Borrowers. Although Ferns grandmother defeated the evil Blue Queen in an earlier book, she is losing her powers and it is now up to Fern to save the Anybodies and the world from the resurgent queen and her henchmen, the Somebodies. There is quite a bit of catch-up involved to get readers up to speed here, and a liberal amount of Victorian-like cozy asides from author to reader. Narrow escapes, evil villains, and captured souls from books will keep kids turning pages through an imaginative kaleidoscope of transformations definitely reminiscent of our friends at Hogwarts. Ferns best friend, Howard, is a robotlike wimp who serves as an effective foil to the brave and take-charge Fern, and the Blue Queen is truly terrifying as she gobbles souls from books with the ultimate goal of stealing human ones. Puzzles, anagrams, and references to other childrens books will please young sleuths. Old-fashioned-looking black-and-white sketches contribute to the feel of a classic childrens book.

Here Byers exposes, as only he can, the history and present-day state of college athletics: monetary gifts, questionable academic standards, advertising endorsements, legal battles, and the political manipulation of college presidents.<br>Byers believes that modern-day college sports are no longer a student activity: they are a high-dollar commercial enter-prise, and college athletes should have the same access to the free market as their coaches and colleges. He favors no one as he cites individual cases of corruption in NCAA history. From Byers' first enforcement case, against the University of Kentucky in 1952, to the NCAA's 1987 "death penalty" levied against Southern Methodist University of Dallas, he shows the change in the athletic environment from simple rules and personally responsible officials to convoluted, cyclopedic regulations with high-priced legal firms defending college violators against a limited NCAA enforcement system. This book is a must for anyone involved in college sports--athletes, coaches, fans, college faculty, and administrators.<br>"There has been no other executive in the history of professional, college, or amateur sports who has had such an impact in his area." --Keith Jackson, ABC Sports<br>"Walter Byers has done more to shape intercollegiate athletics that any single person in history. He brought a combination of leadership, insight, and integrity to intercollegiate athletics that we will never again see equaled." --Bob Knight, Head Basketball Coach, Indiana University<br>As NCAA executive director, Byers started the an enforcement program, pioneered a national academic rule for athletes, and signed more than fifty television contracts with ABC, CBS, NBC, ESPN, and Turner Broadcasting. He oversaw the growth of the NCAA basketball tournament to one that, in 1988, grossed $68.2 million. As the one person who has been inside college athletics for forty years, Walter Byers is uniquely qualified to tell the story of the NCAA and today's exploitation of college athletes.<br></p><p>Here Byers exposes, as only he can, the history and present-day state of college athletics: monetary gifts, questionable academic standards, advertising endorsements, legal battles, and the political manipulation of college presidents.The most shocking feature of this expose of American college athletic programs is that it comes from the man who oversaw those programs as executive director of the NCAA from 1951 to 1986. Written with freelancer Hammer, Byers's depiction is a uniformly dismal one principally regarding football and, to a lesser degree, basketball. At the top of the heap are college presidents, whom Byers terms ``world-weary cynics'' and who hold their jobs for relatively short periods compared with tenured faculty members; then there are head coaches, often greedy self-promoters, and their ever-expanding staffs, who take a huge bite out of athletic budgets; at the bottom are the athletes, who actually earn the money but get nothing in return, least of all a good education. Byers points out the sham of calling a multibillion-dollar industry ``amateur,'' but, in a disappointing conclusion, he stops short of advocating salaries for players, proposing instead an unrealistic program of increased job opportunities for athletes. In his nostalgia for the days when academics ruled the campus, Byers comes across as a man of high principles who appears to have expended his energy on a useless cause.

This is not a shy, self-hating writer. This is a minister, a prophet. Now in his 70s, he can still rouse those dozing in the back pews. In this, as in other recent books, the prize-winning writer (one Pulitzer and two National Book Critics Circle Awards) brings recent discoveries to bear on the Gospels. As what was taken for historical fact is changing and falling away, Wills referees the ensuing battle between reason and faith, confident that both can survive intact. The New Testament, he tells us, gives &#34;four different takes on the central mystery. Since the mystery at the center of it all will never be exhausted, we need all of these angles of vision . . . .&#34; B.H.C. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>The Original New Testament: A Radical Translation and Reinterpretation</h2><p>A translation of the Gospels and Epistles into contemporary English is accompanied by a discussion of the historical background of the New Testament</p><p>Text: English, GreekThe author of The Passover Plot offers a translation of the entire New Testament (the first one-man translation since J.B. Phillips's version.) As one would expect, there are controversial elements in the translation itself and in the introductions. For example, attempting to be completely objective, Schonfield avoids certain well-established but ecclesiastically ``overloaded'' terms, such as supervisor for bishop and envoy for apostle. However, supervisor and envoy are not neutral terms; they have their own connotations. A one-man translation will not rival the significance of the ``official'' translations, but because of Schonfield's reputation this present work should achieve some popularity. Comparing it with the ``official'' translations will give a fresh experience of the New Testament text. John Moryl, Yeshiva Univ.

The Munich Olympics. Palestinian members of the Black September group murder eleven Israeli athletes. Nine hundred million people watch the crisis unfold on television, witnessing a tragedy that inaugurates the modern age of terror and remains a scar on the collective conscience of the world.<br>Back in Israel, Prime Minister Golda Meir vows to track down those responsible and, in Menachem Begin&#x2019;s words, &#x201c;run these criminals and murderers off the face of the earth.&#x201d; A secret Mossad unit, code named Caesarea, is mobilized, a list of targets drawn up. Thus begins the Israeli response&#x2013;a mission that unfolds not over months but over decades. The Mossad has never spoken about this operation. No one has known the real story. Until now.<br>Award-winning journalist Aaron Klein&#x2019;s incisive and riveting account tells for the first time the full story of Munich and the Israeli counterterrorism operation it spawned. With unprecedented access to Mossad agents and an unparalleled knowledge of Israeli intelligence, Klein peels back the layers of myth and misinformation that have permeated previous books, films, and magazine articles about the &#x201c;shadow war&#x201d; against Black September and other terrorist groups.<br>Spycraft, secret diplomacy, and fierce detective work abound in a story with more drama than any fictional thriller. Burning questions are at last answered, including who was killed and who was not, how it was done, which targets were hit and which were missed. Truths are revealed: the degree to which the Mossad targeted nonaffiliated Black September terrorists for assassination, the length and full scope of the operation (far greater than previously suspected), retributive acts against Israel, and much more. <br>Finally, Klein shows that the Israeli response to Munich was not simply about revenge, as is popularly believed. By illuminating the tactical and strategic purposes of the Israeli operation, Striking Back allows us to draw profoundly relevant lessons from one of the most important counterterrorism campaigns in history.</p><p>Aaron J.

The driver was alone in the vehicle. He stopped twice, to buy food from a vending machine and gas from a pump. Five hours later, his surveillance tail almost lost him in the swirling rush-hour traffic of a Paris afternoon. On Rue du Commandant Mouchotte the trackers watched the new Renegade with the German plates, B-585X, make a sudden right turn. The driver of the surveillance car floored the accelerator and caught a glimpse of the Jeep as it dropped into the shadows of an underground parking garage. A quick look at the building explained the unexpected move: the garage belonged to the Le M�ridien Montparnasse Hotel, an old, quality establishment in the heart of the upscale Montparnasse district, with over nine hundred rooms and suites, and a reputation for discretion. The visitor took the elevator to reception on the first floor. He registered under a pseudonym, paid cash, and went straight up to Room 2541 with a small suitcase in his hand.<br><br> The hotel guest was Atef Bseiso, a round-faced, elegantly dressed forty-four-year-old Palestinian who had been living in Tunis for the last ten years. He was the Palestine Liberation Organization-the PLO-liaison officer, working with, among others, the French internal security service, the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire (DST). He was considered a rising star in his organization. His good relations with European intelligence agencies were, in large part, a product of his personal charm and charisma.<br><br> Bseiso was drained from the drive-he had covered the six-hundred-mile journey in nine hours flat. Despite his fatigue and the alluring pull of the room's king-size bed, he went to the phone. Bseiso did not want to pass his only night in Paris with a remote control in his hand. He took out an address book and dialed the number of a PLO bodyguard. In Tunis, Bseiso felt safe; in Europe, he feared the Israelis. He had a list of names and numbers of men, frequently unarmed, who would accompany senior PLO officials in Europe to give them a sense of security. He told the man he'd be going out to dinner. The bodyguard offered to pick Bseiso up at the hotel. "I've driven enough for today," Bseiso said. "Let's say nine at the entrance to the hotel. A tout � l'heure." He showered and got dressed.<br><br> Shabtai Shavit, the head of Israel's Institute for Intelligence and Special Operations, the Mossad, received a brief message in the operation's war room, located in a safe house in the 11th Arrondissement: "He's in the M�ridien Montparnasse. We're getting ready." Shavit leaned back in his chair. The operation was in high gear. Shavit, in his early fifties, had run the Mossad for the past three years, and was well acquainted with undercover operations. He had served for six years as commander of the Mossad's Caesarea unit, which was charged with special operations and with running undercover Mossad combatants in enemy territory. He was in Paris on a borrowed identity: a different name was on the passport in the pocket of his blazer. None of his peers in the French secret service, or any other branch of the French intelligence services, knew he was in the country. His gut told him the mission would go well. He had complete confidence in the professionalism of Caesarea's combatants.<br><br> Ilan C, Caesarea's intelligence collection officer, placed the thirty-by-forty-centimeter pictures of the facade of the M�ridien Montparnasse Hotel on a table in another room in the Mossad safe house. The new pictures had been shot from a variety of angles and included the streets surrounding the hotel. The surveillance team had taken them as soon as Bseiso checked in. The operational plans, drawn up in advance by Caesarea officers, took a number of hotels into consideration, primarily the M�ridien Etoile, an elegant hotel situated a few steps from the Champs-Elys�es-but not the M�ridien Montparnasse. Bseiso's unexpected choice forced them to revise their plans accordingly. The work was done quickly and efficiently. In less than an hour a new plan was brought before Shavit. Time was tight, and Shavit, never garrulous under even the most relaxed circumstances, kept it brief. He asked Caesarea's commander and the head of the assassination squad a few questions about the operation. He honed a few key points, and then, satisfied, approved the mission.<br><br> The surveillance team had followed Bseiso for three days. They tracked him from the moment he arrived in Berlin; his meetings with German intelligence officers of the Bundesamt f�r Verfassungsschutz (BfV); the purchase of the Jeep; his sprint to Paris. A half-dozen combatants, two cars, and two motorcycles comprised the surveillance team. Throughout, none of the operation's planners at Caesarea had any idea where Bseiso would stay. Would he choose the apartment of a friend, a flat set up by the DST, or a plush hotel room, courtesy of the kingly budget of Fatah, the largest faction of the PLO? Now they knew where they had to act. The operation needed to go into full swing immediately, as Bseiso, a notoriously reluctant traveler, might well spend only one night in Paris. Perhaps the following day, after meeting a colleague from the DST, he would return home, and the opportunity that had presented itself would be gone, possibly forever. Intelligence reports showed that Bseiso, whose job demanded frequent travel, tried to stay in Tunis as much as possible. When he did leave, he flew, a mode of travel not so susceptible to Israeli attack. Planes go directly from point A to point B. The traveler is never alone. People in cars meander, stop for gas, and spend the night at hotels. Bseiso, it turned out, was in fact planning to leave the following evening. He would drive to Marseilles, put the Jeep on a ferry to Tunis, and surprise his wife, Dima, and their three children with the new car.<br><br> The Israelis waited in ambush outside the hotel. They assumed Bseiso would go out for dinner. When he returned, tired and contented, they would act. The late hours of the night, when the streets are quiet and empty, were always best for covert operations. The final decision would be in the hands of the two assassins, "Tom" and "Frank." The point man, Tom, would pull the trigger. Up until the last instant, he would have the authority to call off the operation: he would raise his weapon only when certain that his team would emerge unscathed.<br><br> Atef Bseiso was a target because of the role he played in the slaughter of eleven Israeli Olympians in Munich, in 1972, almost twenty years prior. Shabtai Shavit wanted him to pay the price for participating in the killings. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir authorized the mission and gave it his blessing. The state of Israel was on the verge of closing its case against another one of the "bastards," as they were known in the Mossad, who took part in the Munich Massacre.<br><br> Bseiso did go out to dinner. The Caesarea surveillance team shadowed him, undetected, the whole time. They checked that he wasn't being guarded by his DST hosts. Bseiso, his bodyguard, and an unidentified Lebanese woman spent a pleasant night at a Hippopotamus Grill chain restaurant. It was after midnight when Bseiso picked up the tab and went back to the Jeep. He sat in the back, his bodyguard drove, and his friend sat in the front seat. They had a very loud, animated conversation in Arabic. A short drive brought them to the entrance of the M�ridien Montparnasse. The Rue du Commandant Mouchotte was quiet; few cars passed by.<br><br> Bseiso got out and said goodbye to his friends. He took one step back, preparing to move in the direction of the hotel. A few seconds later, two young men approached him. Their walk was loose, casual. Tom, the point man, raised his hand and pulled the trigger. The Beretta 0.22 issued its shots in silence, the retorts muzzled by a silencer. The three bullets hit Bseiso in the head. He fell on the spot, next to his friend's car, his final inhalation a gurgle. The hot cartridges were caught, along with the clues they held, in a sturdy cloth bag attached to the pistol. Within seconds, the assassin and his backup were rapidly retreating down the street.<br><br> "Abie," the commander of the squad, waited for them near the corner, 150 yards away. He watched them cross to the other side of Avenue du Maine and, from the other side of the street, at a more casual pace, watched their backs. This standard procedure was meant to thwart a mishap during the escape phase of a mission-a highly unlikely scenario, since it takes bystanders many long seconds, if not minutes, to realize that an assassination has just taken place. Nonetheless, the possibility couldn't be ignored. Within twenty seconds the point man and his number two were at the corner of a one-way street. According to Mossad procedure, the getaway car always waits two 90-degree turns from the scene of an operation. The pair made a left onto Rue Vandamme, where the waiting car had kept its motor running.<br><br> Abie suddenly noticed two figures coming after his men. They were breathing heavily and speaking animatedly. This was a fast-approaching threat; they needed to be stopped. They could not be allowed to turn the corner and see the escape vehicle, or, even worse, commit the license plate to memory. Abie started toward them, his quick pace authoritative and threatening. When he was within fifteen feet of the pair he pulled out his Beretta. Holding it in front of their faces, he shouted: "Stop!" The weapon froze them in their tracks. They put their hands in the air, stumbled backwa...</p><h2>Painted Ladies: San Francisco&#39;s Resplendent Victorians</h2><p>Painted Ladies: San Francisco&#39;s Resplendent Victorians by Pomada, Elizabeth And Michael La</p><p></p><h2>The Complete Illustrated Guide To Shaping Wood</h2><p><p><strong>Introducing a new woodworking series in the tradition of Tage Frid...a series filled with essential information required by woodworkers today.</strong> For the first time ever, all the techniques and processes necessary to craft beautiful things from wood have been compiled into three comprehensive volumes: <em>The Complete Illustrated</em> <em>Guides</em>.

The year is 1905. The new century is still in its infancy. Automobiles are little more than rich men's toys and many short-sighted people feel that everything that can be invented has been invented! In the early 1900's there are only 150 miles of paved road in the entire country. Fifty percent of Americans live and work on farms. Radios and refrigerators are still years away. Women are not allowed to vote yet and Teddy Roosevelt is in office. Against this background come two adverturesome boys, Temple and Bud Abernathy. Raised by their widowed father, "Catch-'em-Alive" Jack Abernathy, known as the man from Oklahoma who catches wolves with his hands . . . the boys, ages 5 and 9, set out on a series of daring rides across America. First, alone on horseback from Frederick, Oklahoma to Sante Fe, New Mexico and back. Then to New York City, alone on horseback to meet the! ir friend "Teddy" and back to Oklahoma driving their own "Brush" automobile. Their longest ride and again alone and on horseback, takes place in 1911, when two New York promoters challenge the boys to ride from Coney Island to San Francisco in 60 days time. The boys are allowed only one change of horses and they cannot sleep or eat under roof during the entire trip or they forfeit the $10,0000 prize money! It is hard to comprehend how diferent the country is today from just 90 years ago! The story is captivating and an important piece of Americana and rare that it can be shared by an entire family!</p><p>Alta Abernathy, wife of Temple Abernathy for 64 years is a gifted storyteller. Alta spent many years with the TRITA Story Club in Wichita Falls, Texas and shared her association with the National Story Art League. Though blinded in 1988, two years after Temple&#39;s death, it was her greatest hope to preserve the stories for future generations that Temple had told her over the years about his adventurous childhood. Alta&#39;s daugher, Barbara Abernathy Harris, became her Mother&#39;s eyes in accomplishing the manuscript. Alta is a shining example of the spirit of the 20th Century female. She is a beautiful person and an inspiration to all that are priviledged to know her!" Bud &amp; Me is a classic " <p>" As I read Bud &amp; Me, I kept thinking - this is fiction. Then I'd turn a page and here's a newspaper clipping or a picture of the boys and it brings it to life. This is not just a story, this really happened! Bud &amp; Me is really a classic!

Charles Colson and Nancy Pearcey show how the truth of Christianity can change the world. Internationally known author Charles Colson believes this to be the most significant book of his career. It carries a profound message needed by the church today and by individual Christians. The central theme is that faith in Jesus Christ is more than a private relationship with God; it&#39;s a way of seeing, understanding, and changing the world. Christian faith brings with it basic ideas and beliefs that are the answers and counters to the world&#39;s philosophies. Christians often feel a loss of confidence in the face of secular philosophy as expressed in the culture of our age. The claims of scientists, New Age beliefs, shifting morality and so on can confuse. The authors provide the tools to interpret and confront the false, bankrupt ideas of the world and to use the truth of Christianity to make a difference for good. They help their readers to evaluate their own lives and values. Colson and Pearcey offer the challenge -- How Now Shall We Live? This is a message for the church in the new millennium. Change in the world and in culture will not be achieved chiefly through political or social means, but by individual Christians knowing their faith and daring to be agents of God&#39;s grace.</p><p><i>How Now Shall We Live</i> was the heart cry of a people who lived during the Jewish exile from the Promised Land, yet it is no less the unspoken prayer of the faithful today. As author Chuck Colson puts it, "We live in a culture that is at best morally indifferent ... in which Judeo-Christian values are mocked ... in which violence, banality, meanness, and disintegrating personal behavior are destroying civility and endangering the very life of our communities." It is no small wonder that Colson--the founder of Prison Fellowship Ministries and author of several renowned Christian works--considers this book the most important work of his life.<p> America, Colson states, is now in a post-Judeo-Christian era. Technically, this is what "postmodernism" means. In a generation in which the most respected brands of thought about reality declare that "God is dead," it is clear that a faith-based worldview does not prevail. So how do we teach our children that belief in God is respectable and intelligent? How do we fulfill our mandate to make "disciples of all nations" when friends and coworkers find the Christian perspective foolhardy and--in terms of rational thought--almost insane? Most important, how do we renew our entire culture, especially as it infects the global community, with the "common grace" of reinstating a prevailing belief in God and in His moral order?</p><p> These questions' implications are far-reaching, and Colson's thorough inquiry is a ready match for the challenge. In effect, this book delivers a logical, more than just "because the Bible says so" framework for interpreting the Gospel to the postmodern world, while also illustrating the vision for a culture based entirely on Biblical principles--powerful tools, indeed.</p><p> Christians are taught to love God with all their hearts, all their strength, and all their <i>minds</i>. <i>How Now Shall We Live</i> emphasizes that <i>not</i> to use one's mind in this idea-saturated culture is to abandon dying neighbors to bleed by the side of the road while going about one's religious way. As Colson puts it, "turning our backs on the culture ... denies God's sovereignty over all of life." It's this compassionate severity and prodding intelligence that make this book not only a good read, but a life-changing one as well. <i>--Courtenay Gebhardt</i></p>Charles Colson is a popular speaker, radio commentator, former presidential aide to Richard Nixon, and founder of the international Prison Fellowship Ministries. He has also written several books, including "Born Again, Loving God, Kingdoms in Conflict, " and "The Body, " which have shaped Christian thinking. In 1993 Colson was awarded the prestigious Templeton Prize for Progress in Religion, given for extraordinary leadership and originality in advancing humanity's understanding of God. <p> Nancy R.

The book is illustrated throughout with his favourite cartoons.</p><p>Now that Bill Watterson has retired from drawing syndicated cartoons, the only way to get our Calvin and Hobbes fixes is through his book collections. <i>The 10th Anniversary Book</i> is particularly notable, because in addition to getting some of his most wonderful cartoons, we also gain a sense of Watterson as a person. <p> Approximately one-tenth of the book contains essays about matters great and small--from cartooning to life--and stories about the inspiration behind some of his greatest strips. Not surprisingly, Watterson shines through as a being of considerable integrity, and the cartoons gain in depth thanks to his commentary. And, of course, the cartoons in the other 90% of the book are alternately side-splitting hilarious or touching. Happy Anniversary, Bill, and good luck with whatever it is you are doing now!</p>Bill Watterson won the 1986 Reuben Award as Outstanding Cartoonist of the Year, nominated by the National Cartoonist&#39;s Society.

He published over twenty books, received the National Book and National Book Critics Circle Awards, and a MacArthur Fellowship.This is Gould's fourth volume of essays reprinted, with postscripts, from Natural History. Gould's monthly columns seem to take on new meaning in these collectionseach becomes a piece in a mosaic pattern of thought. Thus, The Flamingo's Smile gives a glimpse at the big picture. The essay on the extinction of dinosaurs is placed effectively next to a consideration of humanity's possible extinction through nuclear war. The discussions of evolutionary biology include new pieces from recent research and revisions in previously held beliefs, as well as a surprisingly relevant essay on the decline in batting averages in major league baseball. And, for the first time, Gould writes for the general reader on his own research on Bahamian land snails. This book requires undivided attention, but the reward is special insight into the complexities of evolutionary biology. Susan Klimley, Columbia Univ.

Unbeknownst to the combatants, the War of l812 has ended, but Andrew Jackson, a brave, charismatic American general&#x2014;sick with dysentery and commanding a beleaguered garrison&#x2014;leads a desperate struggle to hold on to the city of New Orleans and to thwart the army that defeated Napoleon. Helping him is a devilish French pirate, Jean Laffite, who rebuffs a substantial bribe from the British and together with his erstwhile enemy saves the city from invasion . . . much to the grateful chagrin of New Orleanians shocked to find themselves on the same side as the brazen buccaneer. Winston Groom brings his considerable storytelling gifts to the re-creation of this remarkable battle and to the portrayal of its main players. Against the richly evocative backdrop of French New Orleans, he illuminates&nbsp;Jackson&#x2019;s brilliant strategy and tactics, as well as the antics and cutthroat fighting prowess of Laffite and his men. <br><br><i>Patriotic Fire</i> brings this extraordinary military achievement vividly to life.</p><p>Winston Groom is the author of thirteen previous books, including <i>Forrest Gump</i>, <i>Better Times Than These</i>, the prizewinning <i>Shrouds of Glory</i>, and <i>Conversations with the Enemy</i>, which was a Pulitzer Prize finalist. His most recent book is <i>1942: The Year That Tried Men&#x2019;s Souls</i>. He lives in Point Clear, Alabama, and Cashiers, North Carolina.Chapter One<br><br>By late autumn 1814, the United States of America, a nation barely thirty years old, was shaky, divided, and on the verge of dissolving. The treasury was empty, most public buildings in Washington, including the Capitol, the White House, and the Library of Congress, had been burned to ashes by a victorious and vengeful British army. New England, the wealthiest and most populous section of the new country, was threatening to secede from the still fragile Union. After two years of war with Great Britain, it appeared to many Americans that their experiment in democracy&#x2014;the likes of which the world had never seen&#x2014;might only have been some strange, nonsustainable political trial and, worse, that a return to the unwelcome fraternal embrace of the English kings seemed inevitable.<br><br>American seaports from the Atlantic to the Gulf of Mexico were blockaded by the British navy and the economy was in ruins because of it, with goods and crops piled up and rotting on the wharves. The U.S. Army was stymied and stalemated; the navy, such as it was, had fared little better, except on the Great Lakes. There was finger-pointing, recrimination, and torment everywhere, from the Congress to the press to ordinary citizens; no one was spared.<br><br>Then, as autumn leaves began to fall, a mighty British armada appeared off the Louisiana coast with the stated purpose of capturing New Orleans, America&#x2019;s crown jewel of the West and gateway to all commerce in the great Mississippi River Basin, a misfortune that would have split the United States in two. New Orleans was as nearly defenseless as a city could be in those days, with only two understrength regular army regiments of about 1,100 soldiers and a handful of untrained milita to throw against the nearly 20,000 seasoned veterans of the British army and navy who were descending upon it as swiftly and surely as a tropical cyclone.<br><br>As word of the impending invasion reached decimated and burned-out Washington, President James Madison and Secretary of War James Monroe sent urgent pleas for the Western states to come to the aid of their stricken countrymen west of the Mississippi. Backwoodsmen from Tennessee and Kentucky were thus recruited into makeshift army units, but they were far off&#x2014;as much as seven hundred miles by land and two thousand miles by water&#x2014;and river transportation was mostly by slow river rafts and flatboats. It was doubtful they could get there in time. Orders from the secretary of war also went out to the legendary Indian fighter Andrew Jackson, then in nearby Mobile, Alabama, after having defeated the large tribe of Creeks who had just perpetrated the bloodiest massacre in American history. Would he go immediately to New Orleans and take charge?<br><br>Yes, of course&#x2014;but of what? Jackson must have wondered. The British fleet contained more than a thousand heavy guns against the perhaps three dozen cannons New Orleans could muster, and what of powder and shot, or flints for muskets and rifles? Assuming that the British didn&#x2019;t overrun them outright, to Jackson&#x2019;s knowledge there was little or nothing in the way of equipment, munitions, or manpower<br><br>in New Orleans for a sustained siege. There were more than 10,000 trained, first-rate British redcoats bearing down, plus the larger roster of the British navy&#x2019;s marines and sailors to support them&#x2014;all this against fewer than a third that number of untrained and poorly armed Americans, even assuming the rubes from Tennessee and Kentucky did somehow arrive in time for the show. Jackson&#x2019;s task was daunting, to say the least.<br><br>This was arguably the gloomiest moment in American history before or since, it being almost universally believed that Britain, still smarting from defeat at the hands of the upstart colonies three decades earlier, now seemed determined to crush, humiliate, and retake her lost possession. And as Britain at that time was the wealthiest and most powerful nation on earth, there was little doubt among many Americans that the British could do it&#x2014;considering what they had done so far&#x2014;and not a few United States citizens prepared, however grimly, to return hat in hand to the iron fists of His Royal Britannic Majesty and life again under the British lion.<br><br>&#x201c;I expect at this moment,&#x201d; declared Lord Castlereagh, the British foreign secretary, &#x201c;that most of the large seaport towns of America are laid in ashes, that we are in possession of New Orleans, and have command of all the rivers of the Mississippi Valley and the lakes, and that the Americans are now little better than prisoners in their own country.&#x201d;<br><br>As it turned out, of course, this was not to be, but no one could have known or even expected it at the time. What they hoped for, but did not count on, was the courage and tenacity of a small band of American warriors, probably the most disparate and slapdash army ever assembled on earth. It consisted of Frenchmen, Spaniards, Germans, Irishmen&#x2014;and their descendants&#x2014;infantry battalions of freed black men, a handful of gunboat sailors, some displanted Acadians (&#x201c;Cajuns&#x201d;) from Nova Scotia, a regiment of pirates and smugglers, a convent of Catholic nuns, companies of prominent New Orleans lawyers and merchants, stranded seamen of all nations, leftover adventurers and soldiers of fortune from the Revolutionary War era, numerous women of New Orleans from high society dames to prostitutes, the two small regiments of U.S. Army regulars, plus the aforesaid backwoodsmen from Tennessee and Kentucky&#x2014;but what an army they became!<br><br>All of this in due time, but first let us focus on the broader picture of just what the fledgling American nation had become by that time, how its people lived, and what they thought of themselves.<br>By 1812 America had grown into a huge but unwieldy economic giant, shipping foodstuffs and raw materials throughout the world. In the more than two centuries since the first colonists settled at Jamestown, huts had been replaced by homes, some of them palatial, and roadways and riverways connected its great cities, which flourished at Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York, Boston, Charleston, and, of course, New Orleans&#x2014;all of them busy harbor ports. A vast westward expansion had begun, carrying settlers into the fertile lands across the Alleghenies, in the process pushing the Indians out of western New York and Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Tennessee, which were now becoming dotted with farms raising corn, grains, cotton, and other cash crops.<br><br>The U.S. population had doubled in the three decades since the end of the Revolutionary War, so that by 1812 there were some eight million Americans, many of them recent immigrants from Great Britain, Ireland, and Germany, with a smattering of French and Spanish, many of these last settling in New Orleans, Mobile, and Charleston&#x2014;all adding to the simmering melting pot that was coming to define the United States.<br><br>By the standards of today, transportation and communications were rudimentary, and the sailing vessel remained the most efficient mode of travel. Railroads and steamboats had recently been invented but were not yet in any significant use in the United States. Thus, for instance, it took about a month to send a message by sea or on horseback from New Orleans to Washington City, as the nation&#x2019;s capital was then called, and another month to receive a reply. The telegraph was still two decades into the future, as were the reaping and threshing machines that took so much of the backbreaking work out of farming. However, Eli Whitney&#x2019;s cotton gin had opened up the Southern states to widespread cultivation of that fabulous crop, and with it the widespread introduction of slavery into the region.<br><br>In the large cities, gas lighting for homes and streets was just being introduced. Among the wealthier classes, most furnishings, fancy dress, and other high-end items were still imported from Europe and England; the less affluent used cheap local goods or made their own. Newspapers and broadsheets thrived as the principal means of information and a number of magazine-type publications of opinion such as the <i>Niles Weekly Register</i> and <i>Debow&#x2019;s Review</i> were also widely circulated.<br><br>The cities had immediately become hotbeds of political activity, much to the disappointment (and even disgust) of George Washington, who had consistently warned against it. After the Revolution ended, Americans had quickly divided up into two &#x201c;factions,&#x201d; or political parties, as they are now called, which reflected&#x2014;as they do today&#x2014;the same two natural divisions of liberal and conservative human philosophy that have dominated political thought ever since the days of ancient Greece and Rome.<br><br>The Federalist party, exemplified by the first U.S. treasury secretary, Alexander Hamilton, a transplanted New Yorker, arguably more closely resembled today&#x2019;s Democrats, advocating big government and federal involvement in regulating the economy, including government sponsorship of manufacturing, industry, and public works, as well as a national monetary system and a standing army&#x2014;in short, more federal control&#x2014;and, of course, higher taxes to support it all.<br><br>On the other hand, the Democratic Republican party, as it was known and defined by Thomas Jefferson and the other Southern presidents, wanted as little government as possible from Washington and, instead, preferred that the various states assume the brunt of governmental activities, including national defense, banking, and, of course, little or no taxation from authorities in Washington. (Plus, there was the ever vexing question of slavery, which Southern states were beginning to suspect was becoming target zero of the small but growing abolitionist movement in the North.)<br><br>To that end, members of both factions had conducted for years a relentless discourse in the nation&#x2019;s newspapers, treating the reading public to snide, confrontational, and often libelous &#x201c;letters&#x201d; published anonymously and signed with pen names usually taken from Greek and Roman classics. This practice sometimes led to duels in which either the offender or the offended was often dispatched to his reward.* In truth, Americans have always been such a fractious people that it remains something of a wonder democracy has survived at all.<br><br>Those citizens who tired of political controversy during the era could indulge in a wealth of literary works by the famous authors and artists of the day. The poems of Lord Byron, William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Percy Bysshe Shelley found their way across the Atlantic and into American parlors and libraries. So did the novels of Jane Austen and Sir Walter Scott. If Americans wanted to read the literature of their own countrymen, Washington Irving was widely known&#x2014;he was America&#x2019;s first internationally acclaimed author&#x2014;and soon thereafter arose James Fenimore Cooper. For those who craved the visual arts and could make the transatlantic voyage, there were the latter-day European masters Francisco Goya and William Blake, or, if not, there were American artists and portrait painters such as Benjamin West, Charles Willson Peale, Gilbert Stuart, and John Singleton Copley.<br><br>Americans of the 1812 era ate pancakes, which had been around since the time of the ancient Egyptians, and mayonnaise was popular, but they ate no tomatoes, which were widely regarded as poisonous. There were, of course, no potato chips, Wheaties, hamburgers, or hot dogs, and much of the main-course table fare was still wild game: turkey, duck, deer, quail, and squirrel; there was domestic pork, chicken, mutton, beef, and seafood as well. They drank tea and coffee when they could get it and otherwise washed down their meals with wine, cider, or whisky.<br><br>Sudden death was an omnipresent reality, and medicine was in its primitive stages (&#x201c;bleeding,&#x201d; for example, was still a widely accepted medical practice, as were blood-sucking leeches, and, as a sort of cure-all for many ailments, patients were commonly fed mercury, one of the most dangerous elements on earth for human ingestion). The average American life span in the early 1800s was forty years or so; frightful epidemics of typhoid and yellow fever ravaged the country every year, as did scourges of cholera, typhus, tuberculosis, diphtheria, influenza, smallpox, dysentery, measles, and uncontrollable staph infections&#x2014;not to mention things like shipwrecks, horse throws and kicks, house fires, the sudden and unpredictable arrival of natural disasters such as hurricanes, and, of course, duels. If you ventured outside the cities there was always the chance of getting eaten up by bears or mountain lions or being scalped by Indians. All in all America was a fairly dangerous place, and many if not most families lost a heartbreaking number of children before they had even reached their teens. Complications from pregnancy and childbirth were the leading causes of death for women of childbearing age.<br><br>Nontheless, by 1812 those eight million Americans&#x2014;except for the dwindling population of Indians and the ever increasing number of slaves&#x2014;had surrounded themselves with eight million pleasurable dreams of &#x201c;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&#x201d; in their brave new world. They believed that they were part of a land of progress and bounty unknown across the far reaches of the Atlantic Ocean. Since the end of the Revolution the U.S. merchant shipping fleet, like the population, had doubled in size, and American exports had tripled. Grain and corn from Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and the newly opened lands to the west were transported across the North Atlantic to feed the peoples of Britain. Virginia, Maryland, Kentucky, and North Carolina provided Europe&#x2019;s nicotine-addicted with tobacco aplenty. The vast cotton plantations of the Deep South were churning out hundreds of thousands of bales of cotton to stoke the looms of the New England states, and those of Manchester, England, and the coastal millworks of France. (Always a bit oddball, New Orleans had become a major supplier of refined sugar from its great sugarcane plantations.) Beneath all this ebullience and prosperity, however, by the time 1812 rolled around America seethed.<br><br>The cause of its indignation was the flagrant and long-standing depredation and bullying by the British, who had not forgiven the upstart American colonists for defeating their army at Yorktown thirty years earlier and setting up their own sovereign nation. All this became exacerbated with the rise of Napoleon and the subsequent war between Britain and France. That decade-old conflict had drained Britain of manpower, and especially of trained seamen, so in order to make up the losses the British navy, acting on orders from London, began intercepting American merchant ships and searching their crews for &#x201c;British subjects,&#x201d; whom they then &#x201c;impressed&#x201d; into their navy.

Wilson&#x2019;s stylistic diversity and versatility are on display in stories that pay tribute to Ray Bradbury (&#x201c;The November Game&#x201d;), use a sentient killer virus as a point-of-view character (&#x201c;Lysing toward Bethlehem&#x201d;), and pay unabashed homage to pure pulp fiction in two yellow peril stories (&#x201c;Sex Slaves of the Dragon Tong&#x201d; and &#x201c;Part of the Game&#x201d;). And finally, Wilson treats us to his popular antihero Repairman Jack at his most inventive: trapped in a drugstore with four killers (&#x201c;Interlude at Duane&#x2019;s&#x201d;).</p></p><p><p>Praise for author F.

Anecdotes, conversations with leading Tibetans and quotations from poetry and proverbs illustrate the Tibetan point of view. Sir Charles Bell gives an inside view of the Tibet which he served for eighteen years on the Indo-Tibetan frontier, spoke and wrote the Tibetan language, and was brought into close touch with all classes from the reigning Dalai Lama downwards. <br><br> Recent developments in Tibet have attracted world wide attention and through this Indian edition, Sir Charles Bell`s classic study will perhaps be more eagerly read now than ever before.</p><p></p><h2>I&#39;m a Big Brother!

Lucas played a central role in the universe of entertainment technologies we see everyday.</p><p>This book ventures in territory never explored, as Rubin-a former member of the Lucasfilm Computer Division-reconstructs the events in Hollywood, in Silicon Valley, and at Lucas&#39; private realm in Marin County, California, to track the genesis of modern media. With unprecedented access to images and key participants from Lucasfilm, Pixar and Zoetrope-from George Lucas and the executives who ran his company, to the small team of scientists who made the technological leaps, Rubin weaves a tale of friendships, a love of movies, and the incessant forward movement of technology. This is a compelling story that takes the reader into an era of technological innovation almost completely unknown.*We can all agree that Pixar is a fantastic company. Every single project they have embarked upon for more than 25 years has been successful, both financially and creatively. Few companies have created a product so consistently good for so long. All the elements that made them great were present at their inception. But the path to that instant was complicated.&nbsp; *&nbsp; *The story of Pixar begins with George Lucas. *&nbsp; *Pixar was founded as "The Graphics Group", one-third of Lucasfilm's Computer Division, in 1979. But the question should be "WHY?" Why would rebel filmmaker George Lucas have spent a disproportionate amount of his newfound wealth to hire computer scientists and what were they charged with doing? What was it like in this kernel within the secretive Star Wars environment? Caught in the swirl between two competitive friends, George Lucas and Francis Coppola. *&nbsp; *If you like computers, Star Wars, Pixar or just movies, you have to read this story.</p><h2>A Spy at the Heart of the Third Reich: The Extraordinary Story of Fritz Kolbe, America&#39;s Most Important Spy in World War II</h2><p>A fascinating account of Fritz Kolbe, a German bureaucrat who worked secretly with the Allies during World War II, describes his harrowing espionage work relaying valuable information on high-level Axis meetings and munitions factories to the Allies. 25,000 first printing.</p><p>Educated at the Ecole Normale Sup�rieure, Lucas Delattre was a journalist for the French newspaper Le Monde, during which time he was a correspondent in Germany from 1989 to 1997. Later, he served as assistant editor in chief at Le Monde des D�bats. He is also the author of a biography of Helmut Kohl. Delattre now works for the Council of Europe and lives in Paris.From the archives of WWII comes this spy story as engaging as any novel. Fritz Kolbe, a worker in the German foreign ministry, used his diplomatic missions between Berlin and Switzerland to pass important war information to American agents. The constant threat of discovery by the Gestapo put him in mortal danger. Michael Prichard botches the few Spanish words in the text but does much better with the German. His brisk pace keeps abundant details from slowing the story, and his clear, distinct voice makes the narration easy to understand. The combination of a reader known for skill at nonfiction and the fascinating elements of Kolbe's deceptions creates an inspirational nugget of U.S. history.

Cantankerous, irreverent, and insufferably opinionated, Bolano also could be tender (about his family and favorite places) as well as a fierce advocate for his heroes (Borges, Cort�zar, Parra) and his favorite contemporaries, whose books he read assiduously and promoted generously. A demanding critic, he declares that in his &#x201c;ideal literary kitchen there lives a warrior&#x201d;: he argues for courage, and especially for bravery in the face of failure. <em>Between Parenthese</em>s fully lives up to his own demands: &#x201c;I ask for creativity from literary criticism, creativity at all levels.&#x201d;</p><p><p>Author of <em>2666</em> and many other acclaimed works, <strong>Roberto Bolano</strong> (1953-2003) was born in Santiago, Chile, and later lived in Mexico, Paris, and Spain. He has been acclaimed &#x201c;by far the most exciting writer to come from south of the Rio Grande in a long time&#x201d; (Ilan Stavans, <em>The Los Angeles Times</em>),&#x201d; and as &#x201c;the real thing and the rarest&#x201d; (Susan Sontag). Among his many prizes are the extremely prestigious Herralde de Novela Award and the Premio R�mulo Gallegos. He was widely considered to be the greatest Latin American writer of his generation. He wrote nine novels, two story collections, and five books of poetry, before dying in July 2003 at the age of 50.</p><p><strong>Natasha Wimmer</strong>&#x2019;s translation of Roberto Bolano&#x2019;s <em>2666</em> won the National Book Award&#x2019;s Best Novel of the Year as well as the PEN Prize.</p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s the most controversial and commanding figure to have emerged since Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa began issuing mature work in the early 1960&#x2019;s... The excellent thing about <em>Between Parentheses</em> is how thoroughly it dispels any incenses or stale reverence in the air. It&#x2019;s a loud, greasy, unkeppt thing. Reading it is not like sitting through an air-conditioned seminar with the distinguished Senor Bolano. It&#x2019;s like sitting on a barstool next to him, the jukebox playing dirty flamenco.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Dwight Garner, <em>The New York Times</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bolano&#x2019;s judgments are a joy to read. <em>Between Parentheses</em> is a treasure chest: filled with odd glittering jewels and fistfuls of gold. In these essays we hear Bolano&#x2019;s real voice, the one he often disguised through the ventriloquism of his fiction.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marcela Valdes, <em>The Nation</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;What a refreshing surprise it is to hear Bolano in his own words.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>J.C. Gabel, <em>TimeOut Chicago</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Bolano frolics in pithy essays on friendship, women, ancestors, and courage. He&#x2019;s irreverent and purposeful, cerebral and casual, insouciantly opinionated and ironic, and charming and funny.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Donna Seaman, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;One emerges from <em>Between Parentheses</em> with the desire to read more &#x2015; to read more Bolano, re-read Borges, to discover Nicanor Parra and Enrique Lihn and Carmen Boullosa.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Marianne Moore, <em>Zyzzyva</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;The essays in <em>Between Parentheses</em> preserve for us the voice of the seasoned and accomplished Bolano, the man who, as he was whipping up these various tapas, was also tending the large pot simmering with the eventual <em>2666</em>, and was very likely aware that his days were numbered. I would like to have the culture, the knowledge, that would let me enjoy his responses to his fellow writers as they were meant to be enjoyed, but even without that&#x2015;and it is a considerable deficit&#x2015;the collection delights. How not? Spirit, where it exists, shines through. Roberto Bolano was one of the ones for whom literature was everything.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sven Birkets, <em>Aysmptote</em></strong></p><h2>Carving on Turning</h2><p>With more than a dozen projects, Carving on Turning will introduce you to the many possibilities of how carving can enhance and beautify your woodturning.

Merton&#39;s gift to all of us is this simple message: the contemplative experience, which uncovers our unity with the Lord and a new vision of life, is not only for monks but for all Christians. This collection highlights the main themes of Merton&#39;s contemplative journey: the search for freedom; prayer of the heart; solitude and silence; love of nature; community life; and work, among others. Guided by his wisdom and insight, readers can uncover their own unique path inward and receive the gift of the contemplative experience.</p><p>"Thomas Merton was perhaps the most beloved Christian spiritual master of the twentieth century. In this thoughtful collection of some of Merton's most enduring meditations, Wayne Simsic offers readers a wonderful interdiction to the Trappist monk's unique approach to the spiritual life. Merton's profound reflections will help all readers - from the skeptical agnostic to the devout Christian - grow steadily in freedom, in self-knowledge, and ultimately, in love with God." James Martin, SJ, author of My Life with the Saints. <p>"Wayne Simsic has done a wonderful job selecting and arranging key passages that reveal Thomas Merton's contemplative life and provide an opportunity to deepen our own. This fine collection offers an invitation definitely worth accepting." Patrick F. O'Connell, coauthor of The Thomas Merton Encyclopedia and past president of the International Thomas Merton Society.</p>Wayne Simsic teaches in the Religious Studies Department of Ursuline College in Cleveland, Ohio, and directs retreats that explore the mystics as spiritual guides.

At the age of 37, Stark shocked her fellow Brits by moving to Baghdad, befriending the locals, studying Arabic and the Koran, and then setting out on expeditions to remote and uncharted areas of the Islamic world by foot, donkey, camel, and car. With her fascination for secret Islamic societies, she resolved to travel to the former home of the Cult of the Assassins and to locate an ancient fortress described by Marco Polo. (The founder of the cult inspired his recruits to murder through the use of hashish, hence their name <i>Hashishin</i>, from which we get <i>assassin</i>.) There was only one problem: she couldn't find the valley on her map. Intrepid and indefatigable, she found a guide to lead her across the empty Persian plains and crested mountain ranges (Stark leaping like a mountain goat while her guide huffed behind) into the practically impregnable valley. There she found the castle ruins covered with wild tulips and surrounded by breathtaking views of the Elbruz Mountains. While there, Stark charted the first accurate maps of the region. Stark also used her charm and her understanding of Persian ways to infiltrate Luristan, a dangerous and forbidden place where she hunted for Neolithic bronzes (by persuading the chief of police to help her loot graves) and searched for buried treasure. The Lurs, a mountainous tribe, were infamous for murder and thievery, but she found them "as cheerful a lot of villains as you can wish to meet, and delighted with us for being, as they said, brave enough to come among them." The Lurs were consistently generous hosts, but thought nothing of raiding her luggage while she slept (stealing being their national pastime and hence nothing to get upset about). While Stark began as an obscure and idiosyncratic adventurer, she was ultimately backed by the Royal Geographic Society, was considered one of the best adventure writers of the century, and even was knighted by the queen of England. With her lively voice and natural perceptiveness she painted a picture of a fascinating world inhabited by charming bandits and armed tribesman now largely gone. While she did it for her own pleasure, in the end, the pleasure is ours. <i>--Lesley Reed</i>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Anabaptism in Outline: Selected Primary Sources</h2><p>Walter Klaassen gathered and translated this comprehensive book of selections drawn from writings and statements of 37 sixteenth-century Anabaptists.

"Discourse ethics" attempts to reconstruct a moral point of view from which normative claims can be impartially judged. The theory of justice it develops replaces Kant's categorical imperative with a procedure of justification based on reasoned agreement among participants in practical discourse. Habermas connects communicative ethics to the theory of social action via an examination of research in the social psychology of moral and interpersonal development. He aims to show that our basic moral intuitions spring from something deeper and more universal than contingent features of our tradition, namely from normative presuppositions of social interaction that belong to the repertoire of competent agents in any society.</p></p><p>This long-awaited book sets out the implications of Habermas&#39;s theory of communicative action for moral theory. &#39;Discourse ethics&#39; attempts to reconstruct a moral point of view from which normative claims can be impartially judged.

Widely recognized as the most significant dietary finding of the last twenty-five years, the glycemic index (GI)&#x2014;an easy-to-understand measure of how foods affect blood glucose levels&#x2014;shows how and why eating low-GI foods has major health benefits for everybody, every day, at every meal. This all-new third edition includes: ? The latest scientific findings on the GI and the myriad benefits of eating low-GI foods ? Instantly readable tables of GI and glycemic load values for more than 500 popular foods and prepared meals, including brand-new GI values for 125 foods ? Dozens of delicious, easy low-GI recipes for everyday meals and snacks ? A brand-new A&#x2013;Z of the 100 key terms used throughout the book ? Answers to nearly 50 of the most frequently asked questions about the GI</p><p>Forget the high-carb, low-carb debate. The glycemic index (GI)--a measure of carbohydrate quality based on how quickly a food raises blood-glucose (blood sugar) levels--is the dietary key to health, say the authors. Contrary to other diets that treat carbohydrates as all alike, <i>The New Glucose Revolution</i> divides carbos according to their GI into two categories. One is high GI (less desirable): carbohydrates that break down quickly during digestion, leading to fast and high blood-glucose response. Examples are baked potatoes, sports bars, instant rice, corn flakes cereal, and baguettes. The other is low GI (more desirable): carbohydrates that break down slowly during digestion, leading to a gradual glucose release. Examples here are pasta, whole grains, fruit, legumes, and yams.<p> A low-GI diet is especially recommended for people with diabetes, abdominal overweight, and Syndrome X, say the authors, who have strong medical, nutritional-science, and diabetes education credentials. They explain the importance of understanding GI values, how GI is determined, health applications, and how to choose low-GI foods and balance the overall GI load. They give cooking tips, menu ideas, and 47 recipes. A 68-page table gives the GI values of many foods, including brand names. <i>The New Glucose Revolution</i> is recommended for health-conscious readers who want to understand the glycemic index and how to incorporate it into their diet. <i>--Joan Price</i></p><b>Jennie Brand-Miller, Ph.D.</b>, one of the world's foremost authorities on carbohydrates and the glycemic index, has championed the GI approach to nutrition for more than 20 years.

Popular historian Cable details life on the East Coast during the three days in which 21 inches of snow fell and winds gusted up to 50 miles an hour. Men, women, and children struggled through the storm in a world that was far enough advanced technologically to be shut down by the weather, but not advanced enough to overcome the snow and ice. Many went out into the storm because they feared losing their jobs or really wanted to work; some just didn't know what was happening. Neither situation is as likely today. Amazing stories of life and death fill this readable social history of a great disaster. Recommended for public and academic libraries. Pat Ensor, Indiana State Univ. Lib., Terre Haute<br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.On March 12, 1888, one of the worst blizzards in the nation's history struck the East Coast from Washington to Maine and wreaked havoc on both land and sea. Particularly hard hit by the three-day storm was New York City, which more than any other urban center of the time relied on modern technology, and Cable (Lost New Orleans) concentrates on that city. Although the actual snowfall was less than two feet, furious winds drove it into drifts as high as 20 or 30 feet; ice was a further problem, paralyzing the extensive elevated railway system and, together with the wind, bringing down electric and phone wires.

Grabbe sets out to summarize what we know through a survey of sources and how we know it by a discussion of methodology and by evaluating the evidence. Grabbe's aim<i> </i>is not to offer a history as such but rather to collect together and analyze the materials necessary for writing such a history. His approach therefore allows the reader the freedom, and equips them with the essential methodological tools, to use the valuable and wide-ranging evidence presented in this volume to draw their own conclusions. </p><br><p> </p><br><p>The most basic question about the history of ancient Israel, how do we know what we know, leads to the fundamental questions of the study: What are the sources for the history of Israel and how do we evaluate them? How do we make them 'speak' to us through the fog of centuries? </p><br><p> </p><br><p>Grabbe focuses on original sources, including inscriptions, papyri, and archaeology. He examines the problems involved in historical methodology and deals with the major issues surrounding the use of the biblical text when writing a history of this period. <i>Ancient Israel</i> makes an original contribution to the field but also provides an enlightening overview and critique of current scholarly debate. It can therefore serve as a 'handbook' or reference-point for those wanting a catalog of original sources, scholarship, and secondary studies. </p><br><p> </p><br><p>Its user-friendly structure and Grabbe's clarity of style make this book<i> </i>eminently accessible not only to students of biblical studies and ancient history but also to the interested lay reader. </p></p><p>Lester L. Grabbe is Professor Emeritus of Hebrew Bible and Early Judaism at the University of Hull.He is founder and convenor of the European Seminar in Historical Methodology.A recent book is <i>Ancient Israel:What Do We Know and How Do We Know it?</i>"Equally well oriented in the historical and archaeological basis for Hebrew and ancient Near Eastern studies and in current theoretical and methodological debates, not many are as qualified as Professor Grabbe to write a volume like this. Combining a multitude of insights, Professor Grabbe is able to show that robust history is not "just another story". Rather, it must contain positivistic truth in some form. This important new book points out the way for future historians of ancient Israel as situated somewhere in the middle between "postmodernism" and "na�ve empiricism""&#x2014;Hans M. Barstad, University of Edinburgh (Hans M. Barstad, University of Edinburgh)<br><br>'The study of the history of ancient Israel has become in recent years a difficult and confusing arena, full of loud and discordant voices and yet crying out for a serious and substantial guide to all the noise. Lester Grabbe, one of the most prolific scholars in the field, offers in <i>Ancient Israel</i> a clear and tightly packed review of all the essential issues in reconstructing Israelite history. Particularly striking is his detailed appreciation of the archaeological data, without which, as he demonstrates, a history of ancient Israel would suffer gross distortion and incompleteness. At the same time, Grabbe remains acutely aware of the Hebrew Bible and the challenge of using it as a source on ancient Israel. His summary lists of what, in the light of critical analysis and comparison of the non-Biblical evidence, may be historically accurate, or probable, or inaccurate in the Biblical accounts is only one of the many pluses in this valuable book.'<br>Peter Machinist, Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages, Harvard University, USA<br><br>"There can be no better guide to the subject than <strong>Professor Grabbe</strong>, both for the thoroughness of his discussions and for the convincing nature of his conclusions." Reviewed in <em>Church Times, </em>2008<br><br>"Professor Grabbe has once again admirably served the community of scholars in ancient Israelite history with his newest volume, Ancient Israel...Ancient Israel is a tremendously informed and useful book that readers will find very helpful in a variety of contexts, whether for general pedagogical purposes or as a reader in the seminar context or as a reference tool in the research environment. It is a welcome change of course, given that progress in the field otherwise had all but become stagnant in the rather polarized, late twentieth-century world of minimalism versus maximalism (although one might aver that such a polarizing stage constitutes a predictable [and necessary?] one in the process of intellectual advancement). Readers will be immensely indebted to Professor Grabbe for Ancient Israel. It invited extensive and detailed engagement." - Brian B. Schmidt, <em>Review of Biblical Literature</em>, August 2008 (Brian B. Schmidt)<br><br>"Grabbe's methodology is firmly emphasized: all potential sources should be considered; preference should be given to original sources; the <em>longue dur�e</em> must always be kept in mind; each episode or event has to be judged on its own merits; all reconstructions are provisional; all reconstructions must be argued for. Grabbe notes that writing a history of ancient Israel and Judah is no different than writing any other history and "the most fruitful method is the multiple-source approach." An excellent current 55-page bibliography is a significant strength. Summing up: Recommended. Upper-level undergraduates through faculty/researchers." - H. M. Szpek, <em>CHOICE</em>, August 2008 (H.

(J.A.

Pastors and lay readers will likely find it surprising in many ways, including the information it provides about what ancient historical sources recorded about 'ancient Israel,' how this information cannot help confirm or refute many biblical stories, and how little written evidence (outside the Bible) ancient Israel left of itself." - Interpretation (<i>Interpretation</i>)</p><h2>Up from Slavery (Library of Freedom)</h2><p>For half a century from its publication in 1902 Up from Slavery was the best-known book written by an African American. The life of ex-slave Booker T. Washington embodied the legendary rise of the American self-made man, and his autobiography gave prominence for the first time to the voice of a group which had to pull itself up from extreme adversity.</p><p>Nineteenth-century African American businessman, activist, and educator Booker Taliaferro Washington's <i>Up from Slavery</i> is one of the greatest American autobiographies ever written. Its mantras of black economic empowerment, land ownership, and self-help inspired generations of black leaders, including Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X, and Louis Farrakhan. In rags-to-riches fashion, Washington recounts his ascendance from early life as a mulatto slave in Virginia to a 34-year term as president of the influential, agriculturally based Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. From that position, Washington reigned as the most important leader of his people, with slogans like "cast down your buckets," which emphasized vocational merit rather than the academic and political excellence championed by his contemporary rival W.E.B. Du Bois. Though many considered him too accommodating to segregationists, Washington, as he said in his historic "Atlanta Compromise" speech of 1895, believed that "political agitation alone would not save [the Negro]," and that "property, industry, skill, intelligence, and character" would prove necessary to black Americans' success. The potency of his philosophies are alive today in the nationalist and conservative camps that compose the complex quilt of black American society.This book is in Electronic Paperback Format.

When I was very little growing up in Sweden, they were a formal affair. Only the immediate family attended, food was served on silver, the tree was filled with real burning candles, and my grandmother made hard caramel candies in little paper cups. When I was three years old we moved to Los Angeles, and my mother tried to recreate Sweden in our home. But I knew we were in America when the actor, Audie Murphy, dressed up as Santa and walked up our driveway through a cluster of orange and grapefruit groves. We welcomed him with warm saffron bread.</p><p>These days Christmas is still filled with candles and dinner is still served on my grandmother's china. My mother arranged the Nativity for my children as she had done for me and my brothers, and now my eldest daughter, Natasha, continues the tradition. Traditional Swedish favorites like gingerbread cookies, and meatballs with lingonberries still dominate the menu. And children are still central. It takes us all (kids and grownups!) almost two days to bake the cookies--days during which Christmas carols and the smell of simmering glogg fill the house.</p><p>But now, friends join family for an ever-larger Christmas Eve celebration. Tiny, colored lights illumination the tree, and we have added a gift grab-bag. Each of our guests brings an inexpensive (but creatively chosen) present, and these are the gifts we unwrap and fight over (amidst laughter) before dessert. On Christmas morning, we do stockings.</p><p>Through my younger daughter Katrina's marriage to Matty, we have also discovered the ritual of caroling. Every year at her in-laws we join their family and friends to sing. This is a simple, loving evening, as much about music as it is about Christmas. And what beautiful music it is.</p><p>Holidays grow and change as we do. My daughters' Christmases are not the same as mine were, and my grandchildren's will doubtless be different still. But as we add and subtract transitions, I doubt we will ever lose the heart of Christmas. This collection of stories, carols, poems, and recipes speaks from and to that heart. From the quiet and awe we feel listenitig to St. Matthew, to the tears we shed reading The Birds'Christmas Carol, or the laughter we, share decorating our brilliant (or not so brilliant) cookies, this book is about being together, about peace and love, and ahout joy. These are the rituals my family carries and protectively passes down from generation to generation.</p><p>-From my family to yours, Lena Tabori</p></p><h2>Fulgrim: The Palatine Phoenix (6) (The Horus Heresy: Primarchs)</h2><p>The sixth title in The Horus Heresy: Primarchs series, focusing on Fulgrim, primarch of the Emperor's Children Legion.<br><br>Lord of Chemos and bearer of the Palatine Aquila, Fulgrim, primarch of the Emperor&#x2019;s Children, is determined to take his rightful place in the Great Crusade, whatever the cost.

WIth their nightmarish images, bold associative leaps, and volcanic power of emotion, these works are the unmistakable artifacts of a great, wild voice and heart.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><p>YA-- After 20 years, interest in Jim Morrison and the Doors is still intense. American Night is cut from the same cloth as the controversial best seller Wilderness (Random, 1988). It contains a collection of lyrics or performance pieces from the Doors's albums, poems and aphorisms, and a rather trite screenplay. The poetry deals with such topics as love, sex, life, death, and religion. The writing is uneven, ranging from cliched, amateurish pieces to brilliant, poetic works abounding with sensual or surrealistic imagery. The book lacks the photos found in the first volume, but it has a nicer format, making it easier to keep each work separate.<br><i>-John Lawson, Fairfax County Public Library, VA</i><br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Japanese Touch for Your Garden</h2><p>One hundred fifty full-color plates illustrate a guide to creating a Japanese garden that includes ground plans and a concise text</p><p><br>KIYOSHI SELKE was born in Kyoto in 1918 and holds degrees from the Tokyo Academy of Fine Arts and the Tokyo Institute of Technology.

Using Arthur Schnitzler, the sexually emboldened Viennese playwright, as his master of ceremonies, Gay offers a brilliant reexamination of the hundred-year period that began with the defeat of Napoleon and concluded with the conflagration of 1914. This is a defining work by one of America's greatest historians. 12 b/w illustrations.</p><p>Prolific author Peter Gay describes the rise of the middle class in the 19th century through an unexpected lens: the life of Viennese playwright Arthur Schnitzler. Yet Gay's themes are much larger than the somewhat obscure Schnitzler: "If we may call [my book] a biography at all, it is one of a class," he writes. <i>Schnitzler's Century</i> necessarily focuses on the Victorians--a term often applied only to the British, but here extended to all of Europe and the United States--and Gay seeks to portray them in their complexity and diversity. "There are many people who think they have grasped the Victorian mentality when they have smiled at gushy keepsakes, maudlin poems, shy euphemisms, silences about matters that matter," he writes. In fact, "they lived with their eyes open." Gay has written a history of habits, with close attention paid to sexual ones. It is the sort of provocative book that the stereotypical Victorian would want to see removed from the storefront window--but also would want to peek at when nobody else was looking. --<i>John Miller</i>Peter Gay (1923&#x2015;2015) was the author of more than twenty-five books, including the National Book Award winner The Enlightenment, the best-selling Weimar Culture, and the widely translated Freud: A Life for Our Time.</p><h2>A Great Deliverance</h2><p>Fat, unlovely Roberta Teys is found beside her father&#39;s headless corpse, wearing her best dress and with an axe in her lap.

In April 1940 he was brought to the vicinity of the Katyn Forest where the execution of Polish officers was taking place. Before the war Stanislaw was researching the economies of totalitarian countries and his expert knowledge of German economy caught the interest of his Soviet captors. He was recalled from the Katyn Forest to Moscow where he was interrogated and sentenced to forced labour in the GULAG. His survival of death from starvation and exhaustion and subsequent escape from the claws of the NKVD makes for fascinating reading. After having regained his freedom in August 1942, he joined the Polish army under British command in the Middle East.

Miss Katherine Daltry, on the shelf at 23, manages the household of her ungrateful stepmother and silly stepsister, who inherited all of her father's estate. Kate is thrust from the cinders to the spotlight when her stepsister needs a stand-in for a betrothal ball at Pomeroy Castle. Gabriel, youngest princeling of the duchy of Warl-Marburg-Baalsfeld, needs a rich wife to support his archeology habit; Kate is, of course, manifestly unsuitable. Eccentric turns from Professor Biggitstiff, a pickle-eating dog, and an irrepressible godmother spin a candy floss comic romp around a core of heartache. James's deft touch allows the characters to shine through genuinely witty dialogue and an uncluttered plot. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Patterson argues that male-female relations are now in a state of crisis, finds elements of Christian sacrificial symbolism in the lynching of Afro-American boys and men after Reconstruction, and investigates the images of Afro-American men in the current media. Annotation c. by Book News, Inc., Portland, Or.</p><p>African Americans have triumphed over slavery and continue to fight the good fight against racism and segregation in America, but according to noted Harvard sociologist Orlando Patterson, the battles have exacted a heavy price on Afro-American social relations. With pointed, precise, and often painful prose, Patterson outlines several areas of contention in the black community: combustible male-female relations, the destructive media images of African American males, and the horrible legacy of lynching and its parallel of religious sacrifice. His conclusions may be controversial for some, as were those of 1997's <i>The Ordeal of Integration</i>, but Patterson takes on the role of a doctor willing to endure the protests of his patient to lead him to good health. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i><b>Orlando Patterson</b> is the John Cowles Professor of Sociology at Harvard University.</p><h2>The Loudest Scream (Fear Street: Fear Park, No. 2)</h2><p>In the wake of several terrible accidents at Fear Park, Diedre Bradley pursues a relationship with the intense and mysterious Robin Fear and learns of his plans to destroy the park, even at the cost of Diedre&#39;s life.

It gives us pictures of two lives--and many surrounding lives--from different angles, as if they had been taken with a stereoscopic camera. Thereby it gives us an impression of depth and substantiality that have been lacking in other memoirs of Paris in the 1920's." -- Malcolm Cowley, New York Times Book Review</p><p>There was no more exhilarating decade in the history of modern letters than the twenties in Paris. They were all there: Ezra Pound, Ernest Hemingway, Gertude Stein, James Joyce, John Dos Passos, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Mina Loy, T. S. Eliot, Djuna Barnes, Ford Madox Ford, Katherine Mansfield, Alice B. Toklas... and with them were Robert McAlmon and Kay Boyle.</p><p>Their collaborative memoir began as a book written by McAlmon in 1934. In the late 1960s, Kay Boyle revised and edited the book, adding alternating chapters of her own. The result is a marvelous chronicle of the period as seen through two sets of perceptive eyes. As both writers tell wonderful anecdotes--of Joyce on his evening binges, of Stein holding court, of Hemingway at his most vicious--they beautifully evoke 1920s Paris in this sad, funny, informative, and nostalgic memoir.</p><p>"On his side of the dual autobiography (an interesting device which works very well here) McAlmon tells fascinating stories... and he is always honestly direct. You like the man and you like the book... On the other side, Kay Boyle is a delightful writer with a style that can be dazzling, yet strong as steel... It is Miss Boyle who gives us the airy magic of Camelot-Paris simply by telling us the story of her hopelessly romantic life." -- Mario Puzo</p></p><p><p>A beautiful evocation of 1920s Paris in a sad, funny, informative, and nostalgic memoir.</p><p>Robert McAlmon was essayist, poet, and fiction writer, as well as an influential publisher. His Contact Publishing Company published, among others, William Carlos Williams, Mina Loy, Ernest Hemingway, H.D., and Gertrude Stein. Kay Boyle was an award-winning writer of novels, short stories, poetry, children's books, memoirs, nonfiction, and translations.</p></p><h2>Nothing to Hide (A Roland March Mystery)</h2><p>The Stakes Have Never Been Higher for this Homicide Cop<br><br><i>Publishers Weekly</i> calls J. Mark Bertrand's writing "gritty and chilling." He returns once more to the streets of Houston for another twisting mystery featuring Detective Roland March. This time, a new case is launched by the discovery of a headless corpse...only the investigation quickly becomes complicated when a blood sample analysis brings a phone call from the FBI.<br><br>The body was an undercover agent working to bring down Mexican cartels. The feds want the case closed rather than risk exposing other agents in the field, but March can't abide letting a murder go unsolved. And he doesn't have to dig long to figure out something isn't right. Someone is covering something up, and it seems that everyone has something to hide. Maybe even March, as the case soon intersects, unexpectedly, with the murder that led him to become a homicide cop, all those years ago.</p><p>A grisly homicide. An international threat.<br>The stakes have never been higher for<br>Detective Roland March.<br><br>The victim's head is missing, but what intrigues Detective Roland March is the hand. The pointing finger must be a clue--but to what? According to the FBI, the dead man was an undercover asset tracking the flow of illegal arms to the Mexican cartels. To protect the operation, they want March to play along with the cover story. With a little digging, though, he discovers the Feds are lying. And they're not the only ones.<br>In an upside-down world of paranoia and conspiracy, March finds himself dogged by injury and haunted by a tragic failure. Forced to take justice into his own hands, his twisting investigation leads him into the very heart of darkness, leaving March with nothing to lose--and nothing to hide.<br><br>"Plot-driven and suspenseful, with well-developed characters, this should appeal to readers of Terri Blackstock." -- <i>Library Journal</i>J.

The "Earliest People" map, with its settlements of Australopithecus, Neanderthal, and modern man of the late Upper Pleistocene, makes graphic sense of excavation sites like Lascaux and Szeleta. Other maps show the spread of agriculture (7000-2000 B.C.), early Greece, the span of the Hallstatt Celtic culture, Imperial Rome, the Russian Revolution, and European trade ties circa 1300. There's also a thought-provoking illustration showing where displaced peoples went in postwar Europe, providing relevant data for discussion of contemporary ethnic conflicts. <i>--Stephanie Gold</i></p><h2>Little House Friends (Little House Chapter Book)</h2><p>Laura and her family and friends share a series of adventures, from racing ponies with Cousin Lena to bobsled rides with Cap Garland and the gang . . . and even mean old Nellie Oleson cannot spoil their fun! Simultaneous.</p><p><p>Laura Ingalls Wilder (1867&#x2013;1957) was born in a log cabin in the Wisconsin woods. With her family, she pioneered throughout America&#x2019;s heartland during the 1870s and 1880s, finally settling in Dakota Territory. She married Almanzo Wilder in 1885; their only daughter, Rose, was born the following year. The Wilders moved to Rocky Ridge Farm at Mansfield, Missouri, in 1894, where they established a permanent home. After years of farming, Laura wrote the first of her beloved Little House books in 1932. The nine Little House books are international classics. Her writings live on into the twenty-first century as America&#x2019;s quintessential pioneer story.</p><br><br><p>Ren�e Graef received her bachelor's degree in art from the University of Wisconsin at Madison. She is the illustrator of numerous titles in the Little House publishing program, as well as Rodgers and Hammerstein's <em>My Favorite Things</em> and E.T.A Hoffman's <em>The Nutcracker,</em> adapted by Janet Schulman. She lives in Cedarburg, Wisconsin, with her husband and two children.</p><b><p>Chapter One</p><p>Laura and Lena</p></b><p>When Laura first saw Lena, she knew she would like her. Lena's eyes were black and snappy. Her curly hair was black as black could be.</p><p>"Do you like to ride horseback?" Lena asked Laura right away. "We've got two black ponies. I can drive them all by myself Tomorrow I'm going for the washing. You can come too, if you want to. Do you?"</p><p>"Yes!" said Laura.</p><p>Lena was Laura's cousin. She was one year older than Laura, and she had a little brother named Jean. Lena and Jean lived with Uncle Hi and Aunt Docia in a railroad camp in Dakota Territory.</p><p>Uncle Hi worked for the railroad. Laura's Pa had come to help him. Laura and her sisters, Mary, Carrie, and baby Grace, and their Ma and Pa had traveled all the way from Minnesota to Dakota Territory. They were staying with Uncle Hi and Aunt Docia until they found a place of their own.</p><p>Uncle Hi and Aunt Docia's little house was so crowded, there was no room for Laura and Lena. They had to sleep in a tent.</p><p>After supper, Lena took Laura outside. The tent looked small under the big black sky. It seemed far away from the warm, cozy house.</p><p>When Laura peeked inside, she saw that the tent was empty. There was onlya blanket spread over the grass on the ground. Laura felt a little lost and lonesome. She didn't think she would like sleeping on the ground in a tent. She wished Ma and Pa were there.</p><p>Lena thought it was great fun to sleep in the tent. She flopped down right away.</p><p>"Don't we undress?" Laura asked sleepily. She was very tired. It had been a long journey from their little house on the banks of Plum Creek in Minnesota. Now she was far away, in a strange new place.</p><p>"What for?" Lena asked. "You only have to put on your clothes again in the morning. Besides, there aren't any covers."</p><p>So Laura lay down beside Lena. She closed her eyes, and in no time at all, it was morning.</p><p>Sunshine coming through the tent woke Laura. She opened her eyes just asLena opened hers. The girls looked at each other and laughed.</p><p>"Hurry up!" Lena sang out. "We're going for the washing!"</p><p>Since they hadn't undressed, there was no need to dress.</p><p>Laura and Lena jumped up and ran outside. The sun was shining, and the prairie stretched out as far as Laura could see. There were two black ponies grazing in the tall prairie grass. Their shining manes and tails were blowing in the wind.</p><p>"We've got to eat breakfast first," Lena said. "Come on, Laura! Hurry!"</p><p>They raced inside the house. Everyone was already at the table. Aunt Docia was frying pancakes.</p><p>Aunt Docia cooked for all the men in the railroad camp. There were so manymeals to cook, and so many dishes to wash, that Aunt Docia and Lena were busy every day from sunrise to sunset. There was never any time for them to wash their clothes. So Aunt Docia had hired a homesteader's wife to do it for her.</p><p>The homesteaders lived three miles away. It was Lena's job to drive the buggy to pick up the washing.</p><p>After breakfast, Lena untied the black ponies from their picket lines. Laura helped her harness them to the buggy. Lena and Laura climbed up, and Lena took the reins.</p><p>Pa had never let Laura drive his horses. He said she was not strong enough to hold them if they ran away.</p><p>As soon as Lena took the reins, the black ponies began to trot. The buggy wheels turned quickly, and the prairie wind blew. Faster and faster went the ponies. Faster went the wheels. Laura and Lena laughed with joy.</p><p>The trotting ponies touched noses, gave, a little squeal, and started to run.</p><p>Up sailed the buggy, and Laura almost bounced out of the seat. Her bonnet flapped behind her. She held on to the edge of the seat. The ponies were stretched out low, running with all their might.</p><p>"They're running away!" Laura cried.</p><p>"Let 'em run!" Lena shouted. "They can't run against anything but grass!" And then Lena yelled to the ponies, "Hi! Yi! Yi, yi, yee-eep!"</p><p>The ponies' long black manes and tails streamed behind them. Their feet pounded and the buggy sailed. Everything went rushing by too fast to be seen.</p><p>"Hi, yi, yi, yi yipee-ee!" Lena and Laura called together. But the ponies couldn't go any faster. They were going as fast as they could.</p><p>I guess I better breathe them," Lena said. She pulled and pulled until she made the ponies trot. Then they slowed down to a walk. Everything seemed quiet and slow.</p><p>"I wish I could drive," Laura said. I always wanted to, but Pa won't let me."</p><p>"You can drive a ways," Lena offered. Just then the ponies touched noses, squealed, and ran.</p><p>"You can drive on the way home! Lena promised.</p><p>Singing and whooping, they went racing on across the prairie. Every time Lena slowed the ponies, they got their breath back and ran again. In no time at all, they reached the homesteaders' little one-room house.</p><p>The homesteader's wife came out to the buggy. She carried a heavy basket of washing. Her face and arms and bare feet were brown as leather from the sun.</p><p>Lena talked to the homesteader's wife for a while, and then she tugged on the reins. Soon Laura and Lena were far out in the middle of the prairie again.</p></p><h2>Choose Life or Death: The Reams Biological Theory of Ionization</h2><p>The Biological Theory of Ionization explained by Carey Reams.</p><p></p><h2>Grant and Sherman: The Friendship That Won the Civil War</h2><p>"We were as brothers," William Tecumseh Sherman said, describing his relationship to Ulysses S. Grant. They were incontestably two of the most important figures in the Civil War, but until now there has been no book about their victorious partnership and the deep friendship that made it possible.<br><br>They were prewar failures--Grant, forced to resign from the Regular Army because of his drinking, and Sherman, who held four different jobs, including a beloved position at a military academy in the South, during the four years before the Confederates fired on Fort Sumter. But heeding the call to save the Union each struggled past political hurdles to join the war effort. And taking each other's measure at the Battle of Shiloh, ten months into the war, they began their unique collaboration. Often together under fire on the war's great battlefields, they smoked cigars as they gave orders and learned from their mistakes as well as from their shrewd decisions. They shared the demands of family life and the heartache of loss, including the tragic death of Shermans's favorite son. They supported each other in the face of mudslinging criticism by the press and politicians. Their growing mutual admiration and trust, which President Lincoln increasingly relied upon, would set the stage for the crucial final year of the war. While Grant battled with Lee in the campaigns that ended at Appomattox Court House, Sherman first marched through Georgia to Atlanta, and then continued with his epic March to the Sea. Not only did Grant and Sherman come to think alike, but, even though their headquarters at that time were hundreds of miles apart, they were in virtually daily communication strategizing the final moves of the war and planning how to win the peace that would follow.<br><br>Moving and elegantly written, Grant and Sherman is an historical page turner: a gripping portrait of two men, whose friendship, forged on the battlefield, would win the Civil War.<br></p><p>The lives of Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman are classic underdog stories. Both of these "obscure failures" experienced more disappointment than success prior to the start of the Civil War. By 1861, they had each resigned from the U.S. Army and failed in several civilian pursuits between them, including farming, real estate, retail, and banking. Further, Grant was known as a drunk and Sherman was labeled insane. But once they threw themselves into the war effort, their best traits and talents began to reveal themselves. Even their motives were similar--both men joined the war not to eradicate slavery but to hold the Union together, believing that secession was equal to treason. This dual biography gracefully reveals how the two men grew to be "as brothers," why their partnership proved essential to victory for the Union, and how well they complemented and helped each other in their lives and careers, despite some major differences. For instance, though he possessed tremendous talent, Sherman was insecure and initially asked Abraham Lincoln never to give him a superior command. Grant, on the other hand, never doubted his ability to lead, and he quickly, if quietly, moved up the chain of command. Once he recognized Sherman's abilities, Grant made sure to keep him close, and they grew to depend upon each other completely. Through their near-daily interaction, even when separated by distance, both men honed their skills and eventually came up with a winning strategy for the war, which they executed in a brilliant two-pronged assault. <p> The book also discusses Grant's and Sherman's marriages, their relationships with their soldiers, and their dealings with politicians to provide well-rounded and complete portraits of these fascinating leaders. <i>Grant and Sherman</i> is a thoughtful portrait of the two men who "other than Lincoln... would have more to do with winning the war that preserved the Union than anyone else." --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i></p><b>Charles Bracelen Flood </b>is the author of <i>Lee: The Last Years, Hitler: The Path to Victory, </i>and <i>Rise and Fight Again</i>, which won an American Revolution Round Table Award.

He assumed there was no room for God in a modern, scientific mind. But now Strobel has discovered that &#39;the emperor of evolution has no clothes!&#39; As in his first two books---both multi-million sellers---The Case for Christ and The Case for Faith, Strobel assumes the role of skeptic in The Case for a Creator and uses a narrative technique to investigate the latest scientific findings concerning creation. What he has found is that there has never been a time in history when the hard evidence of science was more confirmatory of belief in God than it is today. Instead of science and religion being at odds, many scientists are now driven to faith by their very work. &#39;It is the atheist who has to maintain, by faith, despite all the evidence to the contrary, that the universe did not have a beginning a finite time ago.&#39; The Case for a Creator provides an ironclad apologetic affirming the Christian belief in God as Creator. Yet it is written in an open, accessible style that invites skeptics and seekers to take another look at the evidence for God. This title is also available as unabridged Audio Pages CD.</p><p>Are Christianity and science incompatible? If there is a God, is he only an impersonal starter force? An introductory high school biology class first propelled Lee Strobel toward a life of atheism. God and science, he reasoned, were mutually exclusive.

As Strobel interviews a variety of scientists on everything from debunking evolutionary icons to the implications of the Big Bang to the existence of the human soul, he builds his case: scientific evidence points toward Intelligent Design. <p> Although the discussion often veers into the academic, Strobel works hard to make it accessible to those without scientific training. Throughout the book, he salts interview transcript information with interesting personal stories of his own spiritual and scientific quest for knowledge, as well as sometimes over-detailed descriptions of the actual interviews (right down to the type of beverages consumed). Each chapter contains suggestions for further reading on particular issues of science and faith. </p><p> Strobel concludes that, when correctly interpreted, science and biblical teaching support each other. He quotes physicist Paul Davies, "...science offers a surer path to God than religion." Open-minded readers will find that this book, and its questions for reflection and group study, invites conversation and investigation.--<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>Lee Strobel (www.LeeStrobel.com), with a journalism degree from the University of Missouri and a Master of Studies in Law degree from Yale Law School, was the award-winning legal editor of the Chicago Tribune and a spiritual skeptic until 1981.

The most sought-after photographer of the time was George Hurrell, who perfected the &#34;glamour&#34; portrait. Here, 275 of his classic duotone photos are brilliantly reproduced, using archival prints that preserve his dramatic lighting effects.</p><p>They had faces then, in the golden age of Hollywood when a publicity photo could make or break a star. The visual power of George Hurrell&#39;s portraits, with their Rembrandtesque lighting and dramatic poses, shaped the careers of such stars as Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, and Jane Russell, and did as much or more to establish them as their film performances. Mark Vieira, who adopted Hurrell&#39;s techniques and uses them to this day, explains how the master portraitist lit and retouched his photographs--a portrait of Crawford before and after retouching reveals what an artist the one-time painter really was--and analyzes their impact.George Hurrell was the most sought-after celebrity photographer in Hollywood's Golden Era. He had total control of light, the complete confidence of his subjects, and a storied reputation for making the ordinary beautiful and the beautiful dazzling. The Chapman Collection is one of the most extensive archives of Hurrell's photographs in the world. A close friend of the photographer, Vieira has carefully selected 275 of the images from the collection for this book. The selections leave the reader with a reassuring sense of familiarity with the hundreds of stars, who are remembered here as the film studios planned?as people who amazed us and were bigger than life. Vieira has collected and arranged the stars in this volume in an admiring way, turning Hurrell's incredible ability to merge glamour, creative lighting, star quality, and imaginative posing into a timeless book.

He lives in Columbia, Missouri. Paul Wagner is a producer and director of documentaries for public television and the Smithsonian Institution. He lives in Charlottesville, Virginia.This book, based on a documentary film that will air on PBS stations later this year, is an exceptionally vivid study of Irish immigration from the American Revolution to the present. According to Miller (Emigrants and Exiles, 1985) and documentary filmmaker Wagner, Irish emigration was first prompted in the 17th and 18th centuries by the anti-Catholic Penal Laws that, among other injustices, prevented Irish men and women from purchasing or inheriting land, voting, or holding political office. But the famine of 184550 was the beginning of mass immigration. During this time 500,000 Irish were evicted from their houses by landlords seeking to enlarge their holdings at the expense of their tenants. As the authors graphically describe it, ``thousands of peasants starved to death in their cabins or by the roadsides, their mouths stained green by the grass they had eaten in a vain attempt to stay alive.'' During this period, more than 1,000,000 died as a result of the famine and more than 2,500,000 emigrated to America. Here they found relative prosperity (at least, in contrast to the famine conditions of Ireland) and urged their countrymen to emigrate. They assimilated by becoming laborers: building canals, railroads, and bridges. During the Civil War more than 150,000 joined the Union Army. After the war ``No Irish Need Apply'' signs were still common, but Irish immigrants found that hard work and voting a Democratic ticket could alter the status quo in their favor. Out of this era came colorful politicians like Al Smith in New York and Democratic bosses such as Chicago's ``Bathhouse John'' Coughlin and Boston's John ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald, whose grandson, John F. Kennedy, would become the first Irish Catholic president. Generously illustrated with remarkable photographs, this is an illuminating examination of a subject that is frequently misunderstood or misrepresented, and that remains current--in new waves of Irish emigrants--to this very day. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

It is now a standard in college literature classes across the nation and has been translated for a readership stretching from Japan to Romania.<p>When it was first published, however, its author was unknown. Word of mouth spread slowly among booksellers, librarians, critics and readers with a passion to share their favorite books. In <em>The Bean Trees</em> they found a spirited protagonist, Taylor Greer, who grew up in poor in rural Kentucky with the goals of avoiding pregnancy and getting away. But when Taylor heads west with high hopes and a barely functional car, she meets the human condition head-on. By the time she arrives in Tucson, she has acquired a completely unexpected child and must somehow come to terms with both motherhood and the necessity for putting down roots. Hers is a story about love and friendship, abandonment and belonging, and the discovery of surprising resources in apparently empty places.</p><p>Most readers of <em>The Bean Trees</em> discovered the novel in its paperback edition.

Mid-Winter&#39;s blast is a time of perseverance -- enduring those numbing days when adversity howls across our personal landscape like a cold north wind.

Winner of the 2008 Cordon d&#39; Or Culinary Literature - History Culinary Academy Award. This is the story of the bean, the staple food cultivated by humans for over 10,000 years. From the lentil to the soybean, every civilization on the planet has cultivated its own species of bean. The humble bean has always attracted attention - from Pythagoras&#39; notion that the bean hosted a human soul to St. Jerome&#39;s indictment against bean-eating in convents (because they &#34;tickle the genitals&#34;), to current research into the deadly toxins contained in the most commonly eaten beans. Over time, the bean has been both scorned as &#34;poor man&#39;s meat&#34; and praised as health-giving, even patriotic. Attitudes to this most basic of foodstuffs have always revealed a great deal about a society.

Preserved by dry sands covering what was apparently a thriving Gnostic community, 13 leather-bound papyrus volumes were found in jars in a cliffside by Egyptian peasants. Alone among the 49 works contained in them, THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO THOMAS has created a stir similar to that which followed the find of the Dead Sea Scrolls. It is one of the earliest manuscripts related to the New Testament, and is based in fact, according to the editor-translators, on &#34;a work the primitive text of which must have been produced in Greek about 140AD&#34;. They may supply the &#34;missing Link&#34; in the study of ancient manuscripts and texts which connects the known Gospels with Gnostic, Patristic, Manichaean and even Cathare literature. This authoritative translation has been obtained through the unremitting efforts of an international team of five Coptic and Hebrew scholars who are specialists in Gnosticism and primitive Christian literature. It is based on a most minute reading of the manuscript itself, which has been corrected and reconstituted with the use of infra-red photographs which are, as Professor Piper points out, &#34;clearer than the original itself&#34;.

Though my family was British, we had many French cousins, and that year we all went over to Paris to see them.</p> <p>There was the magical drive around floodlit Paris; the river trip, the walk down the Champs-Elysees. The smell of Gauloises cigarettes--now gone--and French coffee, the taste of real French cooking, a far cry from the food I knew. I took pictures from the top of the Eiffel Tower, and gazed in rapture at the Napoleonic army of toy soldiers in Les Invalides. And then there was the sound of my cousins speaking French--charming, sensuous, mysterious.</p> <p>But it was something unexpected that impressed me most.</p> <p>My French cousin Isabelle was driving me and my father's elderly aunt. By mistake, she made an illegal turn. The police pounced. Isabelle apologized. The policeman was stony-faced. Then Isabelle had an inspiration.</p> <p>"You see, Monsieur, I was taking my aunt from England for a drive," she explained.</p> <p>The policeman bent down, looked at the little old lady on the back seat, stood at attention and saluted. "Passez, Madame," he said gallantly.</p> <p>We've all encountered occasional rudeness in France, but throw yourself on a French person's mercy, and their sense of chivalry usually kicks in. That's the special charm of France.</p> <p>I stayed with my cousins often after that. One Parisian family lived just up the street from Proust's childhood home, and only yards from where the Statue of Liberty was constructed. Others had an old house in Fontainebleau, with a veranda straight out of a Manet painting, and family stories that went back to Napoleonic times. Others lived near the Bastille, or in Hemingway's Montparnasse, or in the Latin Quarter--wonderfully convenient when, as a teenager, I needed to sneak into the revolutionary riots in 1968. All these places found their way into my novel.</p> <p>The son of a laborer taught me street-fighting--my background for the Gascon family. I knew an old monarchist priest who still held the French kings sacred; an aristocrat who'd known Chagall, and a virulent Marxist student. I lived with professional families whose shared memories went back to the days of the Belle Epoque and beyond. These were the sources of my characters and stories.</p> <p>And as a young man, I also fell in love in Paris, with an older woman, which left me with memories of Neuilly when the horse chestnuts are in blossom, and of walks in the Parisian dawn, and an old house with parquet floors that creaked, and the smell of fresh croissants and cafe au lait in the morning.</p> <p>But if Marcel Proust found the past brought vividly back to life by the taste of a madeleine, I too have a taste and smell to share; of eating frogs legs at the age of eight, and being sick afterwards . . . I still can't bear the smell. I'll stick to the croissants and cafe au lait!</p>EDWARD RUTHERFURD is the author of seven novels, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers <i>New York</i>, <i>London</i>, <i>The Princes of Ireland</i>, and <i>The Rebels of Ireland</i>.</p><h2>Little Critter: Just a Day at the Pond</h2><p><p>Summertime is here.

In her new outing, Maron brings the action very close to home: a handsome drifter who was briefly Deborah&#39;s husband during her flaming youth is the chief suspect in a murder, and the land which her father amassed from his profits as a bootlegger is in danger of being sold for tract housing. (To catch up with previous Knott adventures, try Bootlegger&#39;s Daughter and Shooting at Loons.MARGARET MARON grew up on a farm near Raleigh, North Carolina, but for many years lived in Brooklyn, New York. When she returned to her North Carolina roots with her artist-husband, Joe, she began a series based on her own background. The first book, Bootlegger's Daughter, became a Washington Post best-seller that swept the major mystery awards for its year and is among the 100 Favorite Mysteries of the Century as selected by the Independent Mystery Booksellers Association. Later Deborah Knott novels Up Jumps the Devil, Storm Track, and Three-Day Town each won the Agatha Award for Best Novel. In 2008, Maron received the North Carolina Award for Literature, the state's highest civilian honor. And in 2013, The Mystery Writers of America celebrated Maron's contributions to the mystery genre by naming her a Grand Master-an honor first bestowed on Agatha Christie. In 2016, she was inducted into the North Carolina Literary Hall of Fame. To find out more about the author, you can visit MargaretMaron.com.

Will Sam come to the rescue? Finding the answer to this question makes the trip back to Harmony worth turning every page.</p></p><p><p>Philip Gulley is a Quaker minister, writer, husband, and father. He is the bestselling author of <em>Front Porch Tales</em>, the acclaimed Harmony series, and is coauthor of <em>If Grace Is True</em> and <em>If God Is Love</em>. Gulley lives with his wife and two sons in Indiana, and is a frequent speaker at churches, colleges, and retreat centers across the country.</p>Perhaps no author can spin a good smalltown church tale as humorously as Gulley, who has been justly compared to Garrison Keillor for his dry wit. This latest installment in the Harmony, Ind., series is no exception, and it's populated with the characters that series aficionados have come to appreciate. A storm is brewing in Harmony, and pastor Sam Gardner, although on sabbatical, is right in the center of it. Caught in the controversy is seminary student Krista Riley, who is filling in for Sam and rumored to be gay. Leading the charge against her is Dale Hinshaw and spinster Fern Hampton, two members of Harmony Friends whose controlling ways will be recognizable to anyone who ever attended a small church. As the conflict heats up, Sam, battling jealousy over Krista's popularity with some church members (and in fear of losing his job) initially fails to stand up for his interim minister. Gulley's strong message about gay acceptance in the church may feel didactic to more conservative Christians looking for a good story, but is in keeping with the message of tolerance found in his previous books. Occasionally, a character is overdrawn, but this is nonetheless a delightful return to Harmony. <i>(July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sebald travelled to Manchester in 1966, he packed in his bags certain literary favourites which would remain central to him throughout the rest of his life and during the years when he was settled in England. In A Place in the Country, he reflects on six of the figures who shaped him as a person and as a writer, from Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Jan Peter Tripp. Fusing biography and essay, and finding, as ever, inspiration in place - as when he journeys to the Ile St. Pierre, the tiny, lonely Swiss island where Jean-Jacques Rousseau found solace and inspiration - Sebald lovingly brings his subjects to life in his distinctive, inimitable voice. "A fascinating volume that confirms Sebald as one of Europe's most mysterious and best-loved literary imaginations". (Evening Standard). "Sebald was in possession of the uncanny ability to make his own intellectual obsessions, immediately, compulsively his reader's". (Observer). "Irresistible ...an intimate anatomy of the pathos, absurdity and perverse splendour of trying to find patterns in the chaos of the world". (Independent). W . G. Sebald was born in Wertach im Allgau, Germany, in 1944 and died in December 2001. He studied German language and literature in Freiburg, Switzerland and Manchester. In 1996 he took up a position as an assistant lecturer at the University of Manchester and settled permanently in England in 1970. He was Professor of European Literature at the University of East Anglia and is the author of The Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn, Vertigo, Austerlitz, After Nature, On the Natural History of Destruction, Campo Santo, Unrecounted and a selection of poetry, Across the Land and the Water. Jo Catling taught German for a number of years alongside W. G. Sebald at the University of East Anglia, where she is currently a senior lecturer in the School of Literature, Drama and Creative Writing.<br></p><p>W. G. Sebald was born in Germany in 1944 and died in 2001. He is the author of The Emigrants, The Rings of Saturn, Vertigo, Austerlitz, After Nature, On the Natural History of Destruction, Unrecounted, Campo Santo and Silent Catastrophes among other publications.A Comet in the Heavens<br><br>A piece for an almanac, in honor of Johann Peter Hebel<br><br>In the feuilleton which Walter Benjamin wrote for the Magdeburger Zeitung on the centenary of the death of Johann Peter Hebel, he suggests near the beginning that the nineteenth century cheated itself of the realization that the Schatzk�stlein des Rheinischen Hausfreunds [Treasure Chest of the Rhineland Family Friend] is one of the purest examples of prose writing in all of German literature. Out of a misplaced sense of cultural superiority, the key to this casket was thrown among peasants and children, heedless of the treasures concealed within. Indeed, between Goethe&#x2019;s and Jean Paul&#x2019;s praise of the almanac author from Baden and the later appreciation of his work by Kafka, Bloch, and Benjamin, we find scarcely anyone who might have introduced Hebel to a bourgeois readership and thus shown them what they were missing in terms of a vision of a better world designed with the ideals of justice and tolerance in mind. It says something, too, about German intellectual history if we consider what little impact the intercession of these Jewish authors of the 1910s and 1920s had on Hebel&#x2019;s posthumous reputation, by comparison with the effect the National Socialists had when they later laid claim to the Heimatschriftsteller [local or provincial writer] from Wiesenthal for their own purposes. With what false neo-Germanic accents this expropriation took place, and how long it was to prevail, is clearly set out by Robert Minder in his essay on Heidegger&#x2019;s 1957 lecture on Hebel, the whole tenor and expression of which differed not in the slightest from that employed during the Nazi era by Josef Weinheber, Guido Kolbenheyer, Hermann Burte, Wilhelm Sch�fer, and other would-be guardians of the German heritage, who fondly imagined that their jargon was rooted directly in the language of the Volk. When I commenced my studies in Freiburg in 1963, all that had only just been swept under the carpet, and since then I have often wondered how dismal and distorted our appreciation of literature might have remained had not the gradually appearing writings of Walter Benjamin and the Frankfurt School&#x2014;which was, in effect, a Jewish school for the investigation of bourgeois social and intellectual history&#x2014;provided an alternative perspective. In my own case, at any rate, without the assistance of Bloch and Benjamin I should scarcely have found my way to Hebel at all through the Heideggerian fog. Now, though, I return time and time again to the Kalendergeschichten [Calendar or Almanac Stories], possibly because, as Benjamin also noted, a seal of their perfection is that they are so easy to forget. But it is not just the ethereal and ephemeral nature of Hebel&#x2019;s prose which every few weeks makes me want to check whether the Barber of Segringen and the Tailor of Penza are still there; what always draws me back to Hebel is the completely coincidental fact that my grandfather, whose use of language was in many ways reminiscent of that of the Hausfreund, would every year buy a Kempter Calender [Kempten Almanac], in which he would note, in his indelible pencil, the name days of his relatives and friends, the first frost, the first snowfall, the onset of the F�hn, thunderstorms, hailstorms, and suchlike, and also, on the pages left blank for notes, the occasional recipe for Wermuth or for gentian schnapps. Naturally, by the 1950s the stories in the Kempter Calender&#x2014;which first appeared in 1773&#x2014;by authors such as Franz Schr�nghamer-Heimdahl and Else Eberhard-Schobacher, telling of a shepherd lad from the Lechtal or a skeleton discovered in the Bergwald, did not quite live up to the quality of Hebel&#x2019;s own Kalendergeschichten, but the basic format of the Almanac had by and large remained the same, and the multiplication tables, the tables for calculating rates of interest, the saints&#x2019; names beside every date, the Sundays and holy days marked in red, the phases of the moon, the symbols of the planets and signs of the Zodiac, and the Jewish calendar, which strangely enough was still retained even after 1945&#x2014;all this even today constitutes for me a system in which, as once in my childhood, I would still like to imagine that everything is arranged for the best. For this reason, nowhere do I find the idea of a world in perfect equilibrium more vividly expressed than in what Hebel writes about the cultivation of fruit trees, of the flowering of the wheat, of a bird&#x2019;s nest, or of the different kinds of rain; nowhere more readily grasped than when I observe the way in which, with his unerring moral compass, he differentiates between gratitude and ingratitude, avarice and extravagance, and all the various other vices and frailties mankind is heir to. Against the blind and headlong onrush of history he sets occasions when misfortune endured is recompensed; where every military campaign is followed by a peace treaty, and every puzzle has a solution; and in the book of Nature which Hebel spreads open before us we may observe how even the most curious of creatures, such as the processionary caterpillars and the flying fish, each has its place in the most carefully balanced order. Hebel&#x2019;s wonderful inner certainty is derived, though, less from what he knows about the nature of things than from the contemplation of that which surpasses rational thought. Doubtless his continued observations about the cosmos were intended to give his readers a gentle introduction to the universe, to make it familiar so that they may imagine that on the most distant stars, as they glisten in the night like the lights of a strange town, people like us are sitting in their living rooms at home &#x201c;and reading the newspaper, or saying their evening prayers, or else are spinning and knitting, or playing a game of trumps, while the young lad is working out a mathematical problem using the rule of three&#x201d;; and certainly Hebel describes for us the orbits of the planets, noting for our edification how long a cannonball fired in Breisach would take to reach Mars, and speaks of the moon as our most trusted guardian, true household friend, and the first maker of calendars of this earth; yet his true art lies in the inversion of this perspective encompassing even the furthest stars, when from the point of view of an extraterrestrial being he looks out into the glittering heavens, and from there sees our sun as a tiny star, and the earth not at all, and suddenly no longer knows &#x201c;that there was a war on in Austria and that the Turks won the siege of Silistria.&#x201d; Ultimately it is this cosmic perspective, and the insights derived from it into our own insignificance, which is the source of the sovereign serenity with which Hebel presides in his stories over the vagaries of human destiny. Such moments of stopping to stare, in pure contemplation, give rise to his most profound inspiration. &#x201c;Have we not all,&#x201d; he writes, &#x201c;seen the Milky Way, which encircles the heavens like a broad, floating girdle? It resembles an eternal wreath of mist, shot through by a palely gleaming light. But viewed through an astronomer&#x2019;s lens, this whole cloud of light resolves itself into innumerable tiny stars, as when one gazes out of the window at a mountain and sees nothing but green, yet looking even through an ordinary field-glass one can make out tree upon tree, and leaf upon leaf, and gives up counting altogether.&#x201d; Rational thought is stilled, and the bourgeois instinct&#x2014;otherwise so favored by Hebel&#x2014;with its passion for cataloging everything no longer stirs. By often thus abandoning himself to pure contemplation and wonderment, with subtle irony our Hausfreund undermines his own proclaimed omniscience at every turn. Indeed, despite his professional didactic inclinations, he never takes up a central role as preceptor, but always positions himself slightly to one side, in the same manner as ghosts, a number of whom inhabit his stories, who are known for their habit of observing life from their marginal position in silent puzzlement and resignation. Once one has become aware of the way Hebel accompanies his characters as a faithful compagnon, it is almost possible to read his remarks on the comet which appeared in 1811 as a self-portrait. &#x201c;Did it not every night,&#x201d; writes Hebel, &#x201c;appear like a blessing in the evening sky, or like a priest when he walks around the church sprinkling holy water, or, so to speak, like a good and noble friend of the earth who looks back at her wistfully, as if it had wanted to say: I was once an earth like you, full of snow flurries and thunderclouds, hospitals and Rumford&#x2019;s soup kitchens and cemeteries. But my Day of Judgment has passed and has transfigured me in heavenly light, and I would fain come down to you, but I may not, lest I become sullied again by the blood of your battlefields. It did not say that, but it seemed so, for it became ever brighter and more lovely, the nearer it came, more generous and more joyful, and as it moved away it grew pale and melancholy, as if it too took this to heart.&#x201d; Both, the comet and the narrator, draw their train of light across our lives disfigured by violence, observing everything going on below, but from the greatest distance imaginable. The strange constellation, in which sympathy and indifference are elided, is as it were the professional secret of the chronicler, who sometimes covers a whole century on a single page, and yet keeps a watchful eye on even the most insignificant circumstances, who does not speak of poverty in general but describes how back at home the children&#x2019;s nails are blue with hunger, and who senses that there is some unfathomable connection between, for example, the domestic squabbles of a married couple in Swabia and the loss of an entire army in the floodwaters of the Berezina. If the essence of Hebel&#x2019;s epic worldview is the result of a particular disposition and receptiveness of the soul, then the way it is conveyed to the reader, too, has a flavor all its own. &#x201c;When the French army was encamped across the Rhine after the retreat from Germany&#x201d;; &#x201c;after she had left Basel by postchaise via the St. Johannistor and had passed the vineyards on the way into the Sundgau&#x201d;; &#x201c;just as the sun was setting over the mountains in Alsace&#x201d;: in such manner the stories progress. As one thing follows another, so, very gradually, the narrative unfolds. Nevertheless, the language constantly checks itself, holding itself up in small loops and digressions and molding itself to that which it describes, along the way recuperating as many earthly goods as it possibly can. Hebel&#x2019;s narrative style is characterized further by his intermittent borrowings from dialect, of both vocabulary and word order. &#x201c;For to count the stars there&#x2019;s not fingers enough in the whole world,&#x201d; it says in the syntax of Baden or Alsace at the beginning of a piece in the &#x201c;Betrachtungen des Weltgeb�udes&#x201d; [Observations concerning the Cosmos], and in the piece about the Great Sanhedrin in Paris we read: &#x201c;The great Emperor Napoleon accepted this, and in the year 1806, before he began the great journey to Jena, Berlin and Warsaw, and Eylau, he had letters be sent to all the Jews in France that they should from among their midst send him men of sense and learning from all the departments of the Empire.&#x201d; The words are, in this sentence, not set down in accordance with Alemannic usage, but rather follow exactly the word order of Yiddish, which refuses to subordinate itself to the rules of German syntax. This fact alone ought to be enough to refute the primitive Heideggerian thesis of Hebel&#x2019;s rootedness in the native soil of the Heimat. The highly wrought language which Hebel devised especially for his stories in the Almanac makes use of dialect and old-fashioned forms and turns of phrase precisely at those points where the rhythm of the prose demands it, and probably functioned even in his own day more as a distancing effect than as a badge of tribal affiliation. Nor is Hebel&#x2019;s particular fondness for the paratactic conjunctions &#x201c;and,&#x201d; &#x201c;or,&#x201d; and &#x201c;but&#x201d; necessarily indicative of a homespun na�vet�; rather, it is precisely the way he deploys these particles which gives rise to some of his most sophisticated effects. Opposed to any hierarchy or subordination, they suggest to the reader in the most unobtrusive way that in the world created and administered by this narrator, everything has an equal right to coexist alongside everything else. The pilgrim promises to bring the landlady of the Baselstab a shell &#x201c;from the seashore of Ascalon&#x201d; on his return, or a rose of Jericho. And the journeyman&#x2019;s apprentice from Duttlingen says at the graveside of the merchant from Amsterdam, more to himself than to the latter, &#x201c;Poor Kannitverstan, what use are all your riches to you now? No more than my poverty will bring me one day: a shroud and a winding-sheet; and of all your lovely flowers a bunch of rosemary perhaps upon your cold breast or a sprig of rue.&#x201d; In these cadences and inflections at the end of a sentence, which mark the profoundest emotional moments in Hebel&#x2019;s prose, it is as if the language turns in upon itself, and we can almost feel the narrator&#x2019;s hand upon our arm. This sense of fraternit� can be realized&#x2014;far from any thought of actual social equality&#x2014;only against the horizon of eternity, whose other side is the gold background against which, as Walter Benjamin noted, the chroniclers love to paint their characters. In these seemingly inconclusive final clauses, ending as it were on a half note and trailing away into nothingness, Hebel rises above the concerns and considerations of the world and assumes a vantage point from where, as it says in a note in Jean Paul&#x2019;s Nachla�, one can look down on mankind&#x2019;s distant promised land&#x2014;that home, in fact, where, according to another saying, no one has ever been.<br><br>Hebel&#x2019;s cosmographical observations are an attempt, in the clear light of reason, to lift the veil which separates us from the world beyond. Weltfr�mmigkeit [secular piety] and the study of nature take the place of faith and metaphysics. The perfect mechanism of the spheres is, for the Almanac author, proof of the existence of a realm of light which we may at the last enter upon. Hebel permitted himself no doubts on this matter; indeed, his office clearly precluded such a possibility. But in his dreams&#x2014;beyond the reach of the controlling authority of consciousness&#x2014;which for a while he was in the habit of writing down, we find not a few indications that he, too,was prey to troubling fears and insecurities. &#x201c;I was lying,&#x201d; he notes on the fifth of November 1805, &#x201c;in my old bedroom in my mother&#x2019;s house. There was an oak tree growing in the middle of the room. The room had no ceiling, and the tree reached up into the rafters. In places the tree was aflame, which was most lovely to look at. Finally the flames reached the uppermost branches and the roof beams began to catch fire. After the fire had been extinguished, a greenish resinlike substance, which later became gelatinous, was found at the seat of the fire, as well as a great number of ugly dirty-green beetles gnawing greedily at it.&#x201d;</p><h2>Back Before Dark: Sometimes rescuing a friend from darkness ... means going in after them (A Code of Silence Novel)</h2><p><p><strong>Praise for Code of Silence: </strong></p><p>&#x201c;Deliberate, plausible, and gritty whodunit.&#x201d;&nbsp; &#x2013;<em>Booklist</em> Starred Review</p><p>&nbsp;Taken!</p><p>A detour through the park leads Cooper, Gordy, Hiro, and Lunk straight into a trap, and Gordy is abducted!</p><p>For the kidnapper, it&#x2019;s all a game, a way to settle an old score, with no one getting hurt.

In this short book he describes what these giants of the American art world were really like when they relaxed among friends in their favorite neighborhood hangout. You&#39;ll also see how they viewed art criticism as nothing more than profound twaddle -- but appreciated nonetheless for being impressively complimentary, whatever the hell it meant. An impressionistic view of a time and place that no longer exists. You won&#39;t view these artists the same way again, but every word is true.</p><p></p><h2>Firewall: The Iran-Contra Conspiracy and Cover-Up</h2><p>The independent prosecutor in the Iran-Contra investigation exposes a trail of lies perpetrated on the part of the Reagan and Bush Administrations, revealing the full extent of the cover-up and the role of officials from the president on down.</p><p>Lawrence E. Walsh, a distinguished lawyer and the former president of the American Bar Association, lives in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.Walsh, the former independent counsel for Iran/Contra matters, submits an injudicious, self-serving brief in aid of reversing the probable verdict of history that his extended and contentious investigation of malfeasance at the highest levels of US government produced appreciably more heat than light. Drawing on the record he compiled in the course of a six-year investigation, the author delivers a largely chronological narrative built around a rehash of serious charges that were never proved in court. At issue was the question of whether Ronald Reagan exceeded his presidential authority in sanctioning a hushed-up arms-for-hostages deal with Iran, which also yielded cash used to equip the Contra forces in Nicaragua. These clandestine operations came to light in the mid-1980s, and Walsh was called in to unravel the tangled web at the start of 1987. By the author's account, he had no axes to grind at the outset of his inquiry. Perhaps not, but his office became vaultingly ambitious in its selection of targets after failing to put the usual CIA, National Security Council, or White House suspects, let alone Oliver North and John Poindexter, behind bars. At various times, Walsh recounts, he and his aides went after George Bush, Edwin Meese, Donald Regan, George Shultz, and Caspar Weinberger. The fact that he got nary a one of these men in the dock does not stop the author from repeating in detail allegations of supposed misdeeds that resulted in but a single indictment. Attentive readers will learn that feckless subordinates, ill-informed judges, and national-security hurdles, not Walsh, are to blame for the paucity of scalps. A spirited if one-sided effort by Walsh to have the last word on the Iran/Contra affair and to justify his largely unavailing stewardship of the independent counsel's office.

Working from Vasili Mitrokhin&#39;s archive and his own unrivalled expertise in the history of intelligence, Christopher Andrew has created an extraordinary picture of a USSR committed to covert activity at home and abroad to maintain Communism. From technological espionage to the cultivation of agents of influence, the KGB&#39;s methods ranged from financial inducements through sexual blackmail to assassination as they pursued their aims. What emerges is a state apparatus devoted to - even obsessed by - gathering information yet quite incapable of analysing it realistically.</p><p>Christopher Andrew is Professor of Modern and Contemporary History and former Chair of the Faculty of History at Cambridge University. He is also chair of the British Intelligence Study Group, Founding Co-Editor of Intelligence and National Security, former Visiting Professor at Harvard, Toronto and the Australian National University, and a regular presenter of BBC Radio and TV documentaries. His most recent book, The Defence of the Realm: The Authorized History of MI5, was a major international bestseller.

If you, like Nathaniel Hawthorne, are kept up at night wondering about how things work--from electricity to can openers--then you and your favorite kids shouldn't be a moment longer without David Macaulay's <em>The New Way Things Work</em>. The award-winning author-illustrator--a former architect and junior high school teacher--is perfectly poised to be the Great Explainer of the whirrings and whizzings of the world of machines, a talent that landed the 1988 version of <em>The Way Things Work</em> on the <em>New York Times</em> bestsellers list for 50 weeks. Grouping machines together by the principles that govern their actions rather than by their uses, Macaulay helps us understand in a heavily visual, humorous, unerringly precise way what gadgets such as a toilet, a carburetor, and a fire extinguisher have in common. <p><em>The New Way Things Work</em> boasts a richly illustrated 80-page section that wrenches us all (including the curious, bumbling wooly mammoth who ambles along with the reader) into the digital age of modems, digital cameras, compact disks, bits, and bytes. Readers can glory in gears in "The Mechanics of Movement," investigate flying in "Harnessing the Elements," demystify the sound of music in "Working with Waves," marvel at magnetism in "Electricity &amp; Automation," and examine e-mail in "The Digital Domain." An illustrated survey of significant inventions closes the book, along with a glossary of technical terms, and an index. What possible link could there be between zippers and plows, dentist drills and windmills? Parking meters and meat grinders, jumbo jets and jackhammers, remote control and rockets, electric guitars and egg beaters? Macaulay demystifies them all.

Widely held as a work of genius, <i>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i> is the novel that first brought him to the forefront of the international literary scene. Rich in stories, characters and imaginative range, it was written while Kundera was still forbidden to publish in his home country of Czechoslovakia, which was then behind the Iron Curtain. In seven wonderfully integrated parts, different aspects of modern existence from the posthumous erasure of "enemies" of communism from the historical record, to the subtle agony of the fading memory of a lost love, to the bizarre sexlessnes of modern promiscuity are explored with boldness, subversive humor and the magical power of fiction.</p><p>In one of the finer modern ironies of the life-imitates-art sort, the country that Kundera seemed to be writing about when he talked about Czechoslovakia is, thanks to the latest political redefinitions, no longer precisely there. This kind of disappearance and reappearance is, partly, what Kundera explores in <i>The Book of Laughter and Forgetting</i>. In this polymorphous work -- now a novel, now autobiography, now a philosophical treatise -- Kundera discusses life, music, sex, philosophy, literature and politics in ways that are rarely politically correct, never classifiable but always original, entertaining and definitely brilliant.The Franco-Czech novelist Milan Kundera was born in Brno and has lived in France, his second homeland, for more than twenty years. <p>He is the author of the novels <i>The Joke, Life Is Elsewhere, The Farewell Party, The Books of Laughter and Forgetting, The Unbearable Lightness of Being, </i>and<i> Immortality,</i> and the short story collection <i>Laughable Loves</i> all originally written in Czech. </p><p>Like <i>Slowness</i>, his two earlier nonfiction works, <i>The Art of the Novel</i> and <i>Testaments Betrayed,</i> were originally written in French.</p></p><h2>Arnold Friberg: The Passion of a Modern Master</h2><p>Arnold Friberg (December 21, 1913 - July 1, 2010) was an American illustrator and painter noted for his religious and patriotic works. He is perhaps best known for his 1975 painting The Prayer at Valley Forge, a depiction of George Washington praying at Valley Forge.[1][2][3] He is also well known for his 15 &#34;pre-visualization&#34; paintings for the Cecil B. DeMille film The Ten Commandments which were used to promote the film worldwide and for which he received an Academy Award nomination.[1][4][5]</p><p></p><h2>DUNCTON QUEST</h2><p>The magnificent sequel to the worlwide bestseller Duncton Wood</p><p></p><h2>Patterns of Fashion 3: The Cut and Construction of Clothes for Men and Women C. 1560-1620</h2><p>The third volume in Janet Arnold&#39;s groundbreaking series Patterns of Fashion covers an earlier period than the previous two volumes: Patterns of Fashion 1660-1860 and Patterns of Fashion 1860-1940, concentrating on the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. Significantly, too, this is the first of Arnold&#39;s books to include patterns for men&#39;s clothing. As well as Janet Arnold&#39;s meticulous patterns for these remarkable garments, the book includes an amazing 300 black and white photographs ranging from portraits of the period to details of articles of clothing .</p><p>Janet Arnold was a historian of fashion, which combined her two greatest passions: the theatre and clothes. Her early books were conceived as aids for the fashion and theatre students she taught, but as her unique range and depth of knowledge became apparent, more and more museums and other institutions sought her advice and, today, her books are essential tools for the study of dress and have been used throughout the world.</p><h2>The Collected Writings of Joe Brainard: A Library of America Special Publication</h2><p>An artist associated with the New York School of poets, Joe Brainard (1942-1994) was a wonderful writer whose one-of-a-kind autobiographical work <i>I Remember</i> ("a completely original book" -Edmund White) has had a wide and growing influence. It is joined in this major new retrospective with many other pieces that for the first time present the full range of Brainard's writing in all its deadpan wit, madcap inventiveness, self-revealing frankness, and generosity of spirit. <i>The Collected Writings of Joe Brainard</i> gathers intimate journals, jottings, stories, one-liners, comic strips, mini-essays, and short plays, many of them available until now only as expensive rarities, if at all. "Brainard disarms us with the seemingly tossed- off, spontaneous nature of his writing and his stubborn refusal to accede to the pieties of self-importance," writes Paul Auster in the introduction to this collection. "These little works . . . are not really about anything so much as what it means to be young, that hopeful, anarchic time when all horizons are open to us and the future appears to be without limits." Assembled by the author's longtime friend and biographer Ron Padgett and including fourteen previously unpublished works, here is a fresh and affordable way to rediscover a unique American artist.</p><p>RON PADGETT, editor, is the author of many books of poetry including <i>How To Be Perfect</i>, <i>You Never Know</i>, <i>The Big Something</i>, and <i>Great Balls of Fire</i>, as well as <i>Joe: A Memoir of Joe Brainard</i>.The Collected Writings makes its case&#x2014;Brainard surely belongs in this canonical series, in no small part because he represents that peculiarly American aspiration to self-mythologize in the face of an otherwise relentlessly quotidian world. But this is done gently, with affection and a profound sense of commonality with his readers. Sounding playful, sometimes naive notes, Brainard nevertheless advances a serious cause. &#x2014;Albert Mobilio</p><h2>Freddy Goes Camping</h2><p>Freddy Goes Camping [paperback] Brooks, Walter R.

Unfortunately, the War God has other ideas. . . .</p><p>David Weber is one of the top science fiction writers of the 1990s whose acclaimed Honor Harrington series has gained him a devoted and dedicated readership. His many other books include the epic fantasies Oath of Swords and The War God&#39;s Own (also Baen).The creator of sf series heroine Honor Harrington turns successfully to fantasy. Bahzell is a prince of the Hradni, an outsize humanoid race prone to berserk rages. Due to a variety of circumstances, he becomes obliged to flee into regular humans' lands where Hradni are understandably unpopular. He and his companion survive a series of briskly paced adventures in a world Weber builds with a nice eye for detail, above-average knowledge of history, and a pleasing amount of wit. Moreover, the book's ending neither requires nor precludes a sequel. At the moment, Weber is not on a course to high honors or academic reputation but rather is emerging as a consistent producer of highly entertaining and intelligent action tales. <i>Roland Green</i></p><h2>Changes for Rebecca (American Girl Collection)</h2><p>&#34;Let&#39;s make a movie!&#34; Rebecca thinks this is a grand idea, but when her gentle cousin Ana plays the role of a cruel factory boss, the fun turns sour.

And read as she shares the journal entries that capture the essence of pioneer life, often characterized by harsh realities, softened by the beauty, pleasure and friendship found in quiltmaking.</p><p>Betsy fell in love with fabric and quilts as a child learning to sew on both her grandmother's treadle machines. The beds at her grandmother's house in Frisco, Texas, were covered with Depression-era scrap quilts. Her mother would point to each piece fabric and say, "that was my dress, and this was Mother's apron, this was Daddy's shirt, and the one was Sissy's dress" and so forth. In 1969, Betsy received her first sewing machine from her aunt Sissy, a 1940s Singer that she used until 1983.<br> <br> In 1980, Betsy received a B.A. in History from the University of Texas at Arlington. That same year she taught herself to quilt after receiving a quilt top made by a great aunt and great grandmother. This began a passionate journey that would combine the love of fabric, quiltmaking and history. From the time she started to quilt, she wanted her quilts to look like old, 19th Century-era quilts - the ones women used every day, not the pristine heirlooms that were put away only to be brought out for company.<br> <br> Betsy has taught quiltmaking since 1990 for a number of quilt shops in Texas and is a former quilt shop owner. She can most often be found at Lone Star House of Quilts in Arlington, Texas. Since 2004, Betsy has traveled across Texas sharing her love of 19th Century reproduction quilts in lectures, trunk shows and workshops. She is a co-founder of the 19th Century Patchwork Divas, a close-knit group of quilters bound by their love of old quilts. The Divas have had their quilts featured in exhibitions at two International Quilt Festivals in Houston in 2004 and 2009. In 2009, the Diva's exhibition traveled to Chicago, Pittsburgh and Long Beach, Calif., as well as the Rocky Mountain Quilt Museum.</p><h2>The Bear Report</h2><p><p>Amazon Editors recommend this book for children reading with help and building independent reading skills.</p><p>Sophie does not want to do her homework, a research report on polar bears. Bor-ing. They&#x2019;re big. They eat things. They&#x2019;re mean. What else is there to say about them anyway? As it turns out, plenty. And when a polar bear named Olafur swoops her away to the Arctic, she soon learns all about the playful bear&#x2019;s habits and habitat&#x2014;from glacier mice to the northern lights&#x2014;and, despite her first reservations, she finds herself not just interested but excited about the Arctic. When the two are swept out to sea on an iceberg, Sophie&#x2019;s new knowledge and knack for creative thinking pay off in a big way: she calls a whale to their aid! Inspired by her journey, she&#x2019;s ready to return home and take another swing at her assignment, this time with gusto.</p><p><i>The Bear Report</i> showcases the power of curiosity and imagination to fill any blank canvas, whether it&#x2019;s an incomplete homework assignment or the Arctic ice.</p></p><p><b>Thyra Heder</b> is the author of&nbsp;<i>Fraidyzoo</i>, an ALA-ALSC Notable Book, <i>The Bear Report</i> and the forthcoming <i>Alfie</i>: a picture book about the friendship between a girl and her pet turtle told from both points of view, available Fall 2017. She is also an illustrator and storyboard artist for film and advertising and lives in Brooklyn.K-Gr 2&#x2014;Wordless panels show Sophie struggling with her homework. On the following spread, the girl abandons her homework for the TV after she manages to list three "facts" about polar bears: "They are big. They eat things. They are mean." But the page turn brings a giant polar bear right into her living room in a striking spread&#x2014;"We're not ALL mean." The bear introduces himself and insists on taking Sophie on a personal tour of his home in the Arctic, and then miraculously they are there. Lush watercolor illustrations create a breathtaking setting shown from a variety of perspectives that capture the vastness and beauty of the region. The true details of the place become as fantastic as the fantasy elements of the plot. The bear shows Sophie what he likes to eat (his take on fish sticks) and the music he likes (whale song), and after overcoming a near disaster on a melting iceberg, the two share a last moment together enjoying the Northern Lights. Information about the Arctic is peppered throughout the adventure, and the final wordless spread shows Sophie working feverishly into the night on her school assignment.

She is also the author of the teen novels&nbsp;<i>Wildwood Dancing&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>Cybele's Secret.</i>As the lone traveler approached, the five Enforcers spread out in a line across his path. They waited in silence, a team of dark-cloaked warriors in full combat gear, astride their tall black horses. The fellow was roughly dressed&#x2014;hooded cloak of gray felt, woolen leggings, battered old boots&#x2014;and carried only a small pack and a staff. His gait was steady, though his head was bowed. He looked as if he&#x2019;d been on the road awhile.<br><br> &#x201c;Halt!&#x201d; called Rohan Death-Blade when the traveler had come within ten paces and showed no sign of stopping. &#x201c;State your name and your business in these parts!&#x201d;<br><br> The man raised his head. The lower part of his face was covered by a cloth, like a crude imitation of the mask Enforcers wore on duty to conceal their identity. Above this concealment a pair of clear gray eyes gazed calmly at the interrogator. The man straightened his shoulders. &#x201c;Have I been gone so long that you&#x2019;ve forgotten me, Rohan?&#x201d; Though harsh with exhaustion, the voice was unmistakable. They knew him before he peeled off the makeshift mask.<br><br> &#x201c;Owen! By all that&#x2019;s holy!&#x201d; Rohan removed his own mask, swung down from his mount, and strode forward to greet their long-absent commander. The others followed, gathering around Owen Swift-Sword. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s the rest of Boar Troop? We expected you long ago. When will they be here?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Not today.&#x201d; A long pause, as if the speaker must dig deep for the strength to say more. &#x201c;I must speak to the king. Straightaway. Have you a spare mount?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Take Fleet,&#x201d; said Rohan Death-Blade. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll go up behind Tallis. You&#x2019;d best get yourself cleaned up before you see the king; you stink like a midden. Don&#x2019;t tell me you walked all the way from Summerfort.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I have . . . ill news. Grave news. Keldec must hear it first.&#x201d;<br><br> Something in his face and in his voice halted further questioning. They knew that look; they understood the sort of news that rendered a man thus grim and taciturn.<br><br> The king&#x2019;s men mounted their horses and turned for Winterfort. Their troop leader rode with them. Nobody spoke a word.<br><br> &#x201c;Up, girls!&#x201d; The sharp command from the doorway was familiar now. No matter how early we woke, Tali was always up before us. She stood waiting as the four of us struggled into our clothes, tied back our hair, and straightened our bedding. When folk lived at such close quarters over a long winter, keeping everything in order became second nature.<br><br> &#x201c;Hurry up, Neryn.&#x201d; Regan&#x2019;s second-in-command leaned against the doorframe, her tattooed arms folded, observing me as if I were a tardy recruit. &#x201c;I planned to put you on the Ladder later this morning, but two young fellows have turned up at the door&#x2014;Black Crow only knows how they got here through the snow&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll have to test them today. So you&#x2019;ll be training before breakfast. It&#x2019;s the only time I can fit it in.&#x201d;<br><br> My heart sank. When I&#x2019;d first reached the rebel base at Shadowfell, I&#x2019;d been weak. Three years on the road, living rough, moving from one place of hiding to the next, had left me undernourished, sick, and slow to trust. When I was on the run, I had not understood why the king&#x2019;s men were pursuing me, only that my canny gift was more curse than blessing. Indeed, I had hardly known what that gift was. It had taken a long journey and many strange meetings before I&#x2019;d learned that I was a Caller, and that my gift might be key to ending King Keldec&#x2019;s rule.<br><br> My first weeks at Shadowfell had been spent resting, eating what was set before me, and having occasional visits from my fey friends Sage and Red Cap, who were lodged somewhere out on the mountain. I had not been invited to join strategic discussions or to study the various maps and charts Regan kept in the chamber where he did his planning. Everyone at Shadowfell had daily work to do, but I had not been asked to do anything except recover my strength. Regan and his rebel band had treated me as they might a very special weapon&#x2014;they had concentrated on returning me to top condition as swiftly as possible.<br><br> Of recent days I had insisted on helping Fingal in the infirmary, where I could make myself useful preparing salves and tinctures, rolling bandages, and performing additional routine tasks. That freed Shadowfell&#x2019;s healer for other work. Tali&#x2019;s tough winter training regime resulted in a steady stream of sprains, cuts, and bruises for her brother to tend to.<br><br> And now, at last, I had been declared well enough to begin that training myself. For my canny gift, so valuable to the rebels, was not enough on its own; Regan would not allow me to work for the rebellion unless I had at least basic skills as a fighter. I would never be a warrior like Tali or Andra or the other women who shared the sleeping quarters. My years on the road had made me tough, but I was too small and slight to be much use in a fight.

He studied at Newcastle and St. Andrew&#39;s Universities and has a Ph.D. in astronomy. He works as an astrophysicist for the European Space Agency.Starred Review. Astronomer Reynolds's two far-future space exploration novellas, set in his Revelation Space universe (<i>Chasm City</i>, etc.), confirm his mastery of noir SF. Antihero Richard Swift of "Diamond Dogs" joins Mephistophelian Roland Childe's expedition to scale the Blood Spire on the planet Golgotha. As they climb, they must solve increasingly intricate mathematical puzzles, replacing limbs and mental processes with cybernetic constructs as the Spire changes the rules of its lethal game. Naqi Okpik of "Turquoise Days" loses her sister Mina to the sentient ocean of the planet Turquoise. Naqi abandons her humanity, uniting with the ocean to find Mina and save their world from destruction. Spire and ocean are both artifacts of Revelation Space's alien Pattern Jugglers, who form a living gestaltinterstellar entity that in these brilliantly executed parables represents the vehicle for humanity's choice between self-immolation and evolution and the author's postulated solution to the riddle of Faustian man. Reynolds's allegory: if humans embrace science and technology so fervently that body and soul sacrifice themselves to overweening greed, humans will eventually perish in bitter suicide; instead, abandon selfish individuality, immerse the soul in the warm sea of homecoming where minds meet and meld into oneness, and survive, changed forever. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Corral doesn&#39;t hold a candle to the Bone Wars. Following the Civil War, the (Re-)United States turned its attention to the unexplored territories between the Mississippi and the Pacific. The railroads led the way, and to build them we blasted through mountains and leveled valleys and exposed rock that hadn&#39;t seen the light of day for millions of years.This is the story of Edwin Drinker Cope and Othniel Charles Marsh, two scientists who found and fought for those bones, and the artist Charles R. Knight who almost single-handedly brought dinosaurs back to life for an awestruck public. Guest starring Chief Red Cloud and hundreds of his Indian Braves, the gun-totin&#39; and gamblin&#39; Professor John Bell Hatcher, colossal and stupefying Dinosauria of the New World, and featuring special appearances by The Cardiff Giant, P.T. Barnum, Buffalo Bill Cody, Ulysses S. Grant, Alexander Graham Bell, and a plentiful supporting cast of Rogues and Gallants from the Eastern Scientific Establishment and The Old West, the colorful supporting cast makes for a rich blend of history, adventure, science, and art.</p><p><i>Starred Review.</i> Ottaviani has been writing historical graphic novels about scientists for years, but he's outdone himself with this delightful and fascinating account of the late&#x2013;19th-century struggle between two scientists over fossilized dinosaur bones in the American West. Scheming paleontologist Marsh is more or less the villain of the piece, and his scrappy, doomed rival, Cope, is something like a hero, but Ottaviani paints rich, complicated portraits of both and milks their skullduggery for an exciting, fast-paced story. The rollicking narrative includes guest appearances by historical personages who got mixed up in the dispute&#x2014;everyone from President Ulysses S. Grant to P.T. Barnum&#x2014;as well as a subplot involving a hugely popular dinosaur artist, Charles R. Knight. The artwork by the Big Time Attic collective (Zander Cannon, Shad Petosky and Kevin Cannon) is cartoony and whimsical but meticulous when the historical record calls for it. As a bonus, a "Fact or Fiction?" section at the end of the book painstakingly details where Ottaviani has fudged history for a livelier narrative, and where his details are bizarre but true. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

THE ART OF THE PRINT explores the development of the graphic arts from the earliest examples of true prints made in the Far East over a millennium ago to the latest experiments with new materials that have released the print from the flat surface of the sheet of paper and allowed it to assume surprising three-dimensional forms. Every technique of printmaking is covered, from the major processes of woodcut, intaglio, lithography, mezzotint, and silkscreen, to less common processes such as the monotype. Many of the works of art illustrated in THE ART OF THE PRINT have never been reproduced before. The author, Fritz Eichenberg, was Director Emeritus of the Pratt Graphics Center in New York City. He describes and illustrates each of the various techniques expertly and thoroughly, plainly enough for the reader and collector but also professionally enough for studio guidance. In addition to his own eloquent text, Eichenberg has assembled an anthology of statements by such older masters of printmaking as Durer, Rembrandt, Goya, Hogarth, Audubon, Piranesi, Cassatt, Degas, Picasso, Matisse, and Miro, and also comments by contemporary artists such as Rosenquist, Stalla, and Trova. The step-by-step progress of works by Carol Summers and Arthur Deshaies created specifically for THE ART OF THE PRINT is also illustrated. Thus, all the various techniques are investigated, defined, and explained. Illuminating comparisons are also offered between artists who worked centuries apart but who are united by subject or style, with comparative illustrations reproduced side-by-side. And there is a section devoted to the great graphics workshops, past and present, illustrated with prints created in them. Combining a wealth of illustrative material, historical and technical information, and definitive commentary, THE ART OF THE PRINT will provide an indispensable and truly satisfying art book and reference.</p><p></p><h2>The Dispossessed: A Novel</h2><p><p>A literary sensation on its original publication in Hungary, this hypnotic, hauntingly beautiful first novel from the acclaimed, award-winning poet and author Szil�rd Borb�ly depicts the poverty and cruelty experienced by a partly-Jewish family in a rural village in the late 1960s and early 1970s.</p><p><strong>&#x201c;No one has ever written so beautifully and at the same time so without pity about the suffering in the isolated provincial villages of Hungary...His sentences have a surgical precision, and their sustained rhythm only reinforces the power of what they evoke.&#x201d;</strong><strong>&#x2014;Nicole Henneberg, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung<br><br></strong>In a tiny village in northeast Hungary, close to the Romanian border, a young, unnamed boy warily observes day-to-day life and chronicles his family&#x2019;s struggles to survive.

His poems have appeared in English translation in <em>The American Reader</em>, <em>Asymptote</em>, and <em>Poetry</em>.

Why, for example, does an artist choose some subjects and not others? ("I was crazy about the wrong-color sky and the heart-sinking beckoning of headlights on old cars," she acknowledges.) How does a painter draw nourishment from another painter's work? ("I didn't want fancy art theories. I wanted a direct connection with the painting before me.") When is it time to move into a new form? ("I had to go to an empty white canvas and find out what was within me.")<br>More than 60 four-color reproductions of Natalie's distinctive and joyous paintings appear throughout. The result is a feast for the eyes and a celebration of the creative spirit in action.</p><p>In this series of autobiographical essays accompanied by paintings (or autobiographical paintings accompanied by essays), Natalie Goldberg examines the relationship between her writing, her art, and her life. Known for her books about writing (<i>Writing Down the Bones</i> in particular), Goldberg once used painting as others do a walk in the woods or a martini before dinner--as a way to unwind after a day of work. Fearing dilettantism, she quit painting altogether, only to find that when she stopped painting, "I gave up a deep source of my writing, that place in me where I can let my work flow." Once again she embraced visual expression, which she realized she had used "as a metaphor or mirror to break out of something I didn't understand in writing." The paintings have a colorful, folksy feel; the book is an interesting exploration of the influences that the various aspects of our lives have on our work and vice versa.</p><h2>Claudia and the Clue in the Photograph</h2><p>A new passion for photography has Claudia snapping pictures everywhere she goes, including the Stoneybrook Bank, and when it is discovered that a robbery took place at the bank on the very same day, Claudia thinks her photos may contain evidence.

Absolutely, from a freshly minted pair of cute, compu-savvy kids right down to the neatly exhumed chaos theorist Ian Malcolm (who was presumed dead at the close of <i>JP</i>). But is it fun to read?
